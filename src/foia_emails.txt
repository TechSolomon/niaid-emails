I am sorry to bother but I wanted to not ify the Coronavirus Task force about potential blood shortages if blood centers get blood drive cancellations due to the fear in the public. We are starting to see this locally and my concern is that other blood centers in the country are facing the same issue. I tried to contact the office of the vice president, and all I could do was to send an email, which might get lost among thousands . I am hoping you see this and perhaps bring this to the table. Blood centers use updated federal information when educating donors, staff and hospitals but the current fear is tr iggering blood drive cancellations. This might be experienced nationally and will impact the national blood invento ry.

I apologize that I have nothing to offer in return and completely understand if you don't have time to answer. I called the CDC but they were totally unhelpful. I have a question that makes sense to me and I was hoping you could answer and the answer might help a lot of people. I understand that over time I, and everyone else, will very likely get COVI0-19 and that most people won't even realize it because it will be minor. I get that, so th is is not a panicked question. I also understand that while most cases wil l not be severe, the bad cases are compl icated by pneumonia . So my question is: If someone has been vaccinated against pneumonia, will that offer any protection in the event that they do contract COVID-19 and perhaps provide some barrier against the worst effects? Thank you for your time if you have read this and I apologize if this is just another in a long line of ignorant questions, but it made sense in my brain so I thought I would at least ask. Be well, be happy, and may life be kind and generous to you, those you love, and those who love you! sincerely, Aliantha Angel NIH-000972

I am sure you are too busy these days to answer coronavirus questions from the general public. However, you are the only individual I know of who can be trusted to speak intelligently about the pandemic. I know there is no preventive vaccine or cure, and there probably won't be for quite some time- -despite what our ersatz President says. But there is something I don't understand. Since the coronavirus causes pneumonia, wouldn't it be a good idea to vaccinate more of the general population with Pneumova x 23 or Prevnar 13? That certainly wouldn't prevent people from catching coronavirus, but perhaps the resulting penumonia onsets might be a little weaker/short-lived? (b)(6) I figured it couldn't hurt, right?

Cuomo regard ing a new COVID-19 case in NY City. He happened to note that there are currently about 15,000 patients in NY hospitals with the flu. Although multiple government agencies, scientists and health experts keep remind ing us that there are far more cases, hospitalizations and deaths each year from influenza tha n this coronavirus, it strikes me that a more effective, more visual and less fear-producing way of presenting this information would be to present the current number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from EACH of these diseases side by side. If the number of flu cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths isn't available on a daily basis, we could use extrapolations based on known rates. I think this would certain ly go a long way to putting the relative risks of these diseases in clearer focus. Bob lsman, DDS, MPH NIH-001000

I'm neither a physician or a scientist so please accept my apology if my idea is simplistic or isn't feasible. But I was thinking about some of the information presented on why it seems to be less prevalent in children. One theory is that they are exposed to so many other coronavirus's that they experience cross￾protection . So I was wondering if anyone had investigated the idea to flood adults with other, less lethal, coronavirus's as a way to develop some level of immunity? Ideally coronavirus's that are a mat ch to what child ren would be exposed to is what I'm suggesting here. I wou ldn't expect that this wi ll totally protect an adult but it might reduce the severity of the illness if an adult becomes ill and help while a vaccine and treatments are launched. Thank you for considering this idea. Best, Jeff NIH-00100 1

Zablockiene B, Ambrozaitis A, Kacergius T, Gravenstein S. Implication of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection . Biologija 2012; 58(1): 15-25. NO overproduction in influenza virus pneumonia results from a sustained stimulation of inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) (Akaike et al., 1996). Akaike T, Noguchi Y, ljiri S, Setoguchi K, Suga M, Zheng YM, Dietzschold 8, Maeda H. Pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced pneumonia: involvement of both nitric oxide and oxygen radicals. Proc Natl Acad Sci US A. 1996 Mar 19; 93(6) :2448-53. NO overproduction in influenza virus-induced pneumonia can generate highly reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite, via radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide NIH-00 1014 

NIH-001015 [resulting from influenza virus-induced increased levels of xanthine oxidase (XO) (Maeda and Akaike, 1998). Maeda H, Akaike T. Nitric oxide and oxygen radicals in infection, inflammation, and cancer. Biochemistr y (Mose). 1998 Jul; 63(7):854-65 Peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration reactions of various biomolecules (Akaike and Maeda , 2000). Akaike T, Maeda H. Nitric oxide and virus infection. Immunolo gy. 2000 Nov; 101 (3):300-8 . The crucial role of NO in influenza virus-induced pneumonia was demonstrated on iNOS gene knockout mice: at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating pneumonia and death in the wild-type control mice, iNOS gene deficient mice survived with little histopathologic evidence of pneumonia (Karupiah et al., 1998). Karupiah G, Chen JH, Mahalingam 5, Nathan CF, MacMickin g JD. Rapid interferon gamma-dependent clearance of influenza A virus and protection from consolidating pneumonitis in nitric oxide synthase 2-deficient mice. J Exp Med. 1998 Oct 19; 188(8):1541-6 . Both influenza and coronaviruses could have the same pathogenetic mechanism of inducing pneumonia, namely harmful overproduction NO. I would like to present you my innovative idea: Suppressing NO overproduction in COVID-19 complicated to pneumonia with Methylene Blue (MB) Arguments pro: MB is known as a guanylate/guanylyl cyclase inhibitor but it is mainly a NOS inhibitor (nNOS and iNOS). MB is an inhibitor of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase and NADH/NADPH oxidases. MB is a small molecule capable to penetrate in tissues and cells MB was administered intravenously in patients with refractory septic shock and Hepatopulmonary Syndrome of advanced liver cirrhosis . MB administered intravenously will definitively reach the cells where NOS is induced by COVID-19 complicated by pneumonia both in animals and humans: 

-Airway epithelium (includ ing alveolar epithe lial cells); -Alveolar macrophages ; -Capillary/vascular endothel ium (endothelial cells). MB is an inexpensive medication . MB is non-toxic molecule in humans There are only a few cases of MB toxicity published in the literature. These cases occurred in very peculiar situations: Hemolytic anemia in patients with G6-PD deficiency Severe neuropathology after intrathecal administration of MB Eye injury after topical use of MB Tissue necrosis due to the extravasation of injected MB Jejunal atresia following intra-amniotic MB Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRl's) interact with MB, causing a serious adver se reaction consistent with serotonin syndrome .

Please read Hello Dr. Fauci. I am a (b) (6) pharmacist from Ontario, Canada. I was just reading an article that stated covid-19 cases in children under nine y.o. are almost non-existant . I wondered why , and then an answer dawned on me. They have an immunity because one of the childhood vaccines all children get is giving them cross immunity to coronavirus as well. A study should be done immediately to see which one gives cross immuni ty, if indeed that is the reason for their seeming immuni ty to this virus. The immunity must wear off over time which is why adults and seniors seem to lack prior immunity and get sick. This hypothesis is certa inly worth investigating . If this is what is happening, maybe millions of lives could be saved by a simple booster of an existing vaccine. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter. Thanks for your time .

Best, HELP team Questions for Dr. Fauci: 1. How many cases are there in the world? 1n the U.S.? 2. How many deaths so far in the world? In the U.S.? 3. How many countries have cases of the corona virus? 4. How do you know if you have the coronav irus? 5. What are the symptoms? 6. How do you protect yourself? 7. Should we all be wearing masks? 8. If not, why should health care workers have to wear masks? 9. What are the most effective ways to protect your families? 10. If someone has coronavirus symptoms, what should they do? NIH-001031 

NIH-001032 11. If a doctor has a patient with these symptoms, what should they do? 12. Who is most at risk ? 13. What is the mortality rate? 14. Can you explain why there have been relatively few reports of cases in children? 15. This is the peak of the flu season - a. How many flu cases have we had this year so far? b. How many deaths have we had this year from the flu? c. How is the coronavirus different from the seasonal flu? d. Is it possible that we could reduce the infections or deaths from the seasona l flu because you need to do the same things to protect yourself for both types of viruses? 16. Can a person transmit the virus even if they are not showing symptoms? 17. Are your agencies doing any research to determine when exactly an individua l may transmit the virus to others? QUESTION FOR DR. SCHUCHA T: • If a patient is under a federal government-required quarantine , who pays the bills? • Does their insurance pay first, and then does the CDC cover the remaining bills as the payer of last resort? • If CDC is the payer of last resort, does the agency pay the doctor or the hospital directly - or is the patient obligated to send their bills to the CDC? • How and when is this infom1ation made available to the patients under a federal government-required quarantine?

I don't want to over or under-state: America is entering a disturbing new stage in the coronavirus outbreak. There has been community spread in at least one and likely two locations in Washington State. And it appears the virus was being transmitted for at least a few weeks before current cases were recognized. So we can expect dozens or hundreds of cases in those locations unless contact tracing is especially efficient. That means the disease is loose and easily tran smitted. The crucial issue now is the real mortality rate, which remains uncertain. The stated mortality is 2 percent. American experts are hoping the rate turns out to be considerably lower. But the math remains troubling in any case. If only 5 percent of th e population eventually gets infected (which is on the low side of some estimates) and the mortality rat e is 1 perc ent, th ere still would be a few hundred thou sand deaths. NIH-001034 

At this stage, the main tool that public health experts have is social distancing - the attempt to keep as many people as possible in affected areas out of sneezing distance from one another. This means measures such as closing schools, cancelling events in theaters and stadiums and encouraging employees to telework. States and localities ultimately make such decisions rather than the federal government. But according to some health experts I consulted, Washington State should be taking such measures right now. The effectiveness of social distancing is limit ed when action comes too late or ends too early. The goal of such policies is to keep the Ro (reproduction ratio) as low as possible. When people are in close proximity, a single infected person can spread the disease to several others, boosting the Ro of the disease as high as 2 to 3 and causing an exponential increase in cases. If the Ro is less than one, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own, with or without a vaccine. A vaccine, however, would be tremendously helpful. There are at least ten vaccine development projects underway. But the one furthest along at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is still about six weeks away from starting the process of a phase 1 trial in human volunteers that will take 3 to 4 months to complete and to show that the vaccine safe and produces specific antibodies. A phase 2 trial will follow and will take at least 6 to 8 months to determine if the vaccine is efficacious in people at risk for infection . Then production would need to be scaled up by a willing pharmaceutical company to deal with a global crisis. All this in total will take at least a year - assuming there are no unpredicted scientific obstacles in th e way.

The major point is to prevent easy spread of infections in schools (closing them), crowded events such as theaters, stadiums (cancel events), work places (do te lewor king where possible).

The goal of social distancing is to prevent a single person who is infected to readily spread to several others, which is facilitated by close contact in crowds. Close proximity of people will keep the RO higher than 1 and even as high as 2 to 3. If we can get the RO to less than 1, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own without a vaccine.

Whatever it turns out to be, the major tools that we have are public health measures, particularly social distancing, which we have to start doing right now in Washington State and thinking about in other locations. That is really the major weapon that we have. Even though we go into phase 1 with one candidate vaccien in about 6 weeks, vaccine is out of the question for at least a year or more if you want to make sure that you have an effective vaccine, i.e. some efficacy data before massive deployment. We are meeting with pharmaceutical executive today and I will bring up the issue of what the fastest possible time line would be to have a deployable vaccine. ---------- Best regards, Tony -----Original Message----- .

Not for attribution in any way, is this a fair summary? How and when wi ll we know if the disease is on this track? Do we have any better info on mortality yet? And is there any news on the vaccine front? As I understand it, we are not even to Phase 1 trials on anything. If a vaccine is promising, are well talking about late Fall as the earliest possibility? And are there any substantive measures that could be taken to make sure pharma steps up to produce a vaccine on a massive scale once we have It? I'm not sure Americans have been adequately prepared for this possibility. That is partly a political problem (in my view). But what needs to happen soon to get people prepared? Hope you are hold ing up well under all of this and taking care of yourself . NIH-001037

I say exactly what I want to say based on scientific evidence, I have stated this on multiple TV programs over the past few days including at a major press conference with many, many reporters present including several TV cameras. I could not possibly be more public about this. No censor. No muzzle. Free to speak out. On Mar 2, 2020, at 9: 11 AM, Shlomchik , Mark Jay <MSHLOMCH @pitt.edu >wrote: OK, well that is good to know. It has been reported by many outlets including the NYT . So if not true I think it is critica lly important for you to say so publicly and show that it is not the case. It is critical, critical that we all have faith in the science and medical leadership. Your personal integrity is at stake here in the community and the world, and is a proxy for the integrity of science and medicine. According to one house member, the following : Garamendi told MSNBC's Hallie Jackson that Anthony Fauci was scheduled to do all five major Sunday talk shows, but says Fauci canceled the appearances after Vice President Pence took over the administration's response to the disease. Trump on Wednesday named Pence as the official overseeing the government's response. "I can repeat what he said, he said, 'I was not muzzled. However, I was to go on the Sunday talk shows five of them. The vice president's office then took over the control of this situation, and told me to stand down, not to do those shows,'" Garamendi said, quoting Fauci. We cannot mince words about this or have nuances. If you were told not to appear on Sunday talk shows, then a reasonable person would have to assume your speech indeed is being contro lled. Whether you call it "muzzled" or censored is a matter of semantics. Is it factual that you were told/asked not to appear on these shows as had been scheduled? NIH-001043

Fauci, Hope you are doing well despite the rapidly evolving situation w ith COVID-19. I wanted to send you a paper we just published last week that you might find relevant- please find attached and a NIAID piece below. https://www .niaid .nih.gov/news -events/immune -system-status-predicts -future -responses NIH-001063 

This paper asks the question of why do ind ividuals mount variab le immune responses to vaccines , infections , and diseases. This extends from our ear lier work on baseline predicto rs of influenza vaccination responses that you highlighted as a NIAIO Advance in 2014. A key message is that genetics is often unlikely the answer, but the status of the immu ne system before the pert urbation may offer clues - here we ident ified such an immune cell circuit involving pOCs-Type I IFNs prior to perturbation in humans and found that its status can predict vaccinat ion and lupus disease activ ities and is temporally stable within individuals for months. Many thanks ! Best wishes, John.

All of our coronavirus coverage is in front of STAT's paywall and we'd see your contribution as an enormous public service. We would solicit questions for a "live chat" from readers -- and you could pick and choose which ones you want to answer -- and write most of them in advance. Among other leading figures, we 've done this format twice with Nobel winners and it's quite popular . https ://www .statnews .com/events/stat -live-chat-chat-with -a-2019-nobel-winn ing-scientist/ With Helen Branswell, Sharon Begley, Matt Herper, and our whole team, we pride ourselves on covering the coronavirus in the most authoritative and fair-minded way. We've developed a tremendous audience for this coverage. https://www.statnews.com/tag/coronav irus/ Our readers are fairly sophist icated on health and medicine, and we're looking to focus on the health aspects, not the White House polit ics. NIH-001066 

In addit ion, I'd be grateful if you'd consider writing another First Opinion for us, maybe on lessons you've learned regarding other outbreaks and how that might be relevant with coronavirus -- or whatever you'd like.

Last February, I moved to Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of large U.S. companies. Josh is the BRT CEO, and it's been great to work with him again. We wanted to check with you on something quickly . Traditionally, BRT has not weighed in on global health security policy, but COVID-19 has served as a reminder that global companies need to be strong advocates for global public health and security. If you had your choice, what would you want to see our companies advocating for, specifical ly? No worries at all if you don't have time to respond. We fully appreciate how important your time is.

I am reaching out to you in my capacity as President of th e National Economists Club (NEC}, which is an organization of over 1000 government and private sector economists based in DC. The NEC holds weekly luncheon events which feature notable experts and economists in Washington. Increasingly, econom ists are being asked to assess the economic impacts around the incidence and spread of the corona virus as well as the impact of reduced economic activity due to behavioral changes {e.g. people not leaving their homes to work or shop, supply chain disruptions, etc.). As economists are tasked in assessments, scenario planning and communicating their estimates, accuracy around thei r assumptions and understanding of the corona virus and Covid-19 is imperative . We are incredib ly appreciate of the important work and research that the National Institute of Allergy and Infect ious Diseases provides and we are wondering if you would be willing to speak at one of our luncheons about Covid-19 and the latest developments . NIH-001081 

NIH-001082 Do you think you might have time in your schedule to speak to the National Economist Club this month? We would love to have you speak during the week of March 16-20. Our luncheons typically take place at the Chinatown Garden Restaurant, 618 H St. NW, with lunch at noon and your presentation from 12:30 p.m. til 1:30 p.m. Talks are normally on the record and open to the press, unless you request otherwise.

And, my undergraduate degree is in chemistry with a minor in microbiology. I've engaged you previously. Hi Dr. Fauci, You've kindly allowed me to engage you, and I'll take advantage of that kindness. The news media is reporting that the White House has muzzled you. Is that true? Before entering the science/engineeri ng world, I was a newspape r city editor in Southern CA (in the 1970s). Therefore, I get and understand the idea of coordinated messaging. (Plus, due to my media background, Boeing used me to help executives prepare for media engagements on challenging topics.) However, if it's true that you are muzzled, then I will initiate a "campaign" with my congressional representatives and the media to NIH-001083

I recognize tha t you may have backchannels that I may disrupt by engaging.

I think that residents of the US (and, fran kly the worl d) need your insights regarding COVID-19. Plus, you're one of the wor ld leaders with regard to infectious diseases.

We believe it could provide relief to a large number of people dur ing the COVI0-19 pandemic. Our produc t SJP-002 is a combination of an NSAID and a non-sedating antih istamine and does not include a decongestant. Removing the decongestant makes our product ideal for treating the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in pat ients with cardiac conditions who cannot tolerate taking a decongestant. What makes our product novel is that it can be administered early in the treatment phase, thereby reducing the excessive accumulation of inflammat ion, which typically results in head congestion, pulmonary congestion, coughing, & sneezing. Our experience has shown that at the 1st signs of experiencing symptoms of URI an indivi dual's symptoms can be drasti cally reduced after ta king our NIH-001094 

product twice a day for 3 days. The dramatic reduction in inflammation has the potential to reduce the spreading of the virus by means of cough, sneezing, and spreading of germs through contact. Current ly, when individuals experience the start of a URI, there is little effective intervention available to change the course of the infection . Individuals delay administer ing pharmaceutical agents, until their congestion becomes intolerable and excessive. Attached is a copy of our early research and a copy of our non-provisional patent. I share this information with the hope of providing some background for an immediately accessible, safe treatment, alternative to slow the pace and impact of the pandemic. le t me now if we can be of any additional help?

We have trusted you through several previous epidemics to provide such information. Therefore, I know I'm not alone in being appalled and frightened by President Trump wanting you to issue info rmation about the current crises only after it has been cleared by his administration. In his off ice as President, Donald Trump may be de facto, Commander-in Chief. There is nothing about his office that confers Expert-in-Chief on him, and what he chooses to say or not say about Covid-19 and its spread should not be treated by the media or anyone as information that is trustworthy for being factual and scientifica lly-based information to the highest degree tha t it is possible to obtain. I hope that you will find it in yourself and in the mission of your office to publicly assure the American public in no uncertain terms that you will not be censored, and that you will honor the public's trust to continue to provide real, research-based information about the frightening health nightmare that all humans are facing in a way that distinguishes us from China's government in its disgraceful and destructive efforts to muzzle those experts who might be able to save lives by merely speaking truth to a population whose health depends on having fact-based, totally un-massaged know ledge as soon as it is available.

Sherman, MD ------------ Se nt: Friday, February 28, 2020 11:11 AM To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E]-------= (b-c- )(c-=6) Subject: coronavirus Anthony Fauci, M.D. (b)(6) Dear Dr. Fauci: William H. Sherman M.D. (b)(6) I reviewed the publications about the last 2 coronavirus infections. Both MERS and SARS were severe, short lived problems that have not recurred. One would expect Covir-19 to follow a simi lar path : infect a wide group of susceptible people and then disappear, If that is so, anything that is more than six months away may not be of value-remdisivir or a vaccine. Even if remdisivir works, it will take months to produce sufficient amounts to treat this illness. Has ribavirin been assessed for an ability to slow down the replication of this virus? We do not need to eradicate the virus. Just slowing down the rate of symptoms progression would allow time for the immune system to mount a curative response. Ribivirin is the only approved anti-viral that may have shown some clinical benefit against similar coronavirus infections, but the reports are anecdotal and the benefit short term . It was only administered to a few patients who were already on respirator support, and most still died. If their lungs were already destroyed, eliminating the virus would not change the outcome. There were no studies of treating mild illnesses before they progressed to needing respirator support. If the 50 year old coronavirus patient described in the Lancet had been treated in first week of symptoms, before needing respiratory support, he may have survived . On autopsy, most of his lung had been destroyed . If ribavirin has even marginal benefit, decreasing hospitalization by 10% yields an enormous savings. I do not have access to the data on this virus and the possible effects of the antivirals that have been evaluated. However, ribavirin has any effect on viral proliferation, we can write and a randomized trial of ribav irin (b) (4) (b) (4) NIH-001120 

NIH-001121 I look forward to hearing from you about the data on ribavirin against this virus and your thought on this clinical study. Sincerely, William H. Sherman , M.D.

Will we learn: Why there are new cases in the US of unknown origin? Could this virus infect carriers who do not present with :.,ymptoms or present in various levels of very mild infect ion and never get identified as infected? Could individuals host the virus differently due to genet ics or ethnici ty? ls this virus consistently similar after multip le generation or is it capable of mutating? Ts the re an ability to develop an antibody immunity through in fection? Can one be reinfected? Could the level of infection be detenn ined by the amount of inoculant? Could we leam the level of infect ability of this virus by testing everyone in a given geographic area where there is a deep outbreak? We might also learn about the pathogenesis in a way that we cannot learn otherwise. If this virus is so transmissible could we end up with almost everyone eventually being infected and present with various levels of serious acute infection and death to indistinguishable cases or just carriers? With the clamp/filter on infonnation from this administration, please tell us where we may find regular reports at va1ious levels of current science on what we learn about this virus and vaccine progress, and where we may ask question s? I hope there is place for formal and infonna l community input into treatment , care and vaccine development. Thank you for all your help over the years with your wise perspective through our interviews and leadership at the NIH-001146

NIH-001153 Since we are both physicians, we have been following the details of the COVID￾19 outbreak closely. My husband was researching the anti-viral drug remdesivir this morning, and he came across some articles from Chinese studies that indicated a very well-known drug called hydroxychloroquine {already widely used for 70 years to treat malaria and rheumatological diseases) had very potent activity against COVID-19 infection and pneumonia. This was rather surprising to us, but as we read about the study and the characteristics of hydroxychloroquine, we realized that this could be a very good drug to use for the treatment of high-risk patients infected with COVID-19, who might deteriorate rapidly and progress to hospitalization and need for ICU care. Remdesivir also seems like an excellent anti-viral drug, but it is given intravenously, and is probably reserved for COVID-19 patients who are already entering into severe respiratory distress in the hospital. Hydroxychloroguine, on the other hand, is given orally, and is cheap and readily available. Low doses (6.5 mg/ kg) have been effective in the management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. 200 mg tablets are usually prescribed twice a day with meals; dosage can be increased up to the recommended 6.5 mg/kg if the patient tolerates the lower dose. We wondered if the low dose hydroxychloroquine would be able to be studied quickly in various COVID-19 patients, especially those who are older and / or with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for pneumonia and complications {cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc.). In addition, hydroxychloroquine may even be a useful drug to prevent the development of pneumonia in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Because hydroxychloroquine in an older drug that is generic, current pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to do studies or research on its effectiveness for any new medical conditions. Therefore, the federal government would most likely have to construct and fund the studies. Perhaps Dr. Fauci has already considered this kind of study with hydroxychloroquine. We understand that vaccines are already being studied, and Israel is working on an oral (pill) vaccine. Vaccines take time to go through testing and trials, which is why we are suggesting to you that studies be done on hydroxychloroquine, a readily-available oral drug that could "bridge the gap" to provide some potential 

treatment and mitigation of the COVID-19 infections while vaccines are being developed and mass produced. We have attached several articles, which are electronic publications made available in advance (Feb. 4th & Feb 19th , 2020) of the printed journal publications . We wi ll send a copy of this emai l to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, and Dr. Azar. Sincerely yours, Drs. Paul & Karyl Stanton NIH-001154 (b)( 6)

It sterilises all airborne pathogens as air is inhaled by the wearer. See www .medi-immun e.com and in part icular the published report on the tests, by clicking on the report under "The Science" The device is due to undergo further tests, at PHE within the next week, specifically against Covid-19. For verification please contact Professor Nigel Silman at PHE Porton Down. Health Services around the world are doing what they can to prepare for a significant increase in infections from this highly transmissible virus and if those people in the Health Care Sectors are infected the situation could become untenable. The production of vaccines is under way but no one expects them to be available within the next 12 to 18 months. The Medi-Immune "Protect ivAir®", which has been under development for some years and could be available within a few months, will give a far greater level of protection than the current masks and respirators and more importantly can remain in use in the future for other emerg ing airborne pathogens - known, unknown or mutating .

From: Paul Elias Alexander (b) (6)> --------- Sent: Saturday, February 29, 2020 2:34 PM ------ ::;.,...,= To: Fauci, Anthony {NIH/NIAID) [El (b)(6J> -------- Subject: A sharing on COVID ARDS research Hi Dr. Fauci, I am a trained epidemiologist and expert in evidence based medicine. Particularly in developing clinical practice guidelines and I teach EBM and GRADE methods. You have no idea how much 1 have ad.mired you across the years, yoW' intelligence and poise. May I ask how I may help you in this matter, this response, I am not talking about money, 1 wish to help, volunteer. I draw your attention to 2 attachments ... 1) one is a one page 1 wrote to summarize a meta analysis my team just completed and seeking to publish. It pertains to corticosteroids and ARDS. We are raising that this suggests indirect evidence that we may be able to extrapolate to the COVID patient with severe illness. This within the life threatening issue and emergency and no effective treatment. I share if this can NIH-001157 

NIH-001158 help you as I know you are leading this and listened to you today with the president. I support this president fully. 2) I share a paper published today , it on the other hand raises serious questions on the use of corticosteroids in influenza associated ARDS , and one may argue this patient set, is the closes t to the COV ID 19 pat ient. My sense is that the accumulated evidence thus far is weak and argues against corticosteroids. For example, this recently published multicenter retrospective cohort study in medical center ICUs across Ta iwan sought to assess the effect iveness of cort icostero ids in patients presenting with influenza-associated ARDS (viro logy -proven ARDS and are on mechanical vent ilation). Researchers examined the impact of early corticosteroid treatment (2: 200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission , determined by a sensitivity analysis) on subseque nt hosp ita l mortality. The study revea led that of the 241 pat ients with influenza￾associated ARDS , those rece iving early cort icostero id had a sign ificantly highe r hosp ital mortality rate than those who did not get early corticos teroid [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/ 156), p < 0.001 ). Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital morta lity in overall patients [an adjus ted OR of 5.02 (95% CI 2.39- 10.54), p < 0.001) and in all examined subgroups . Researchers found that a higher dose and earli er treatment was linked to higher hospital mortality. Moreover, they found that earlier trea tment was related to a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [an adjusted OR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.01- 5.56)]. These resu lts underscore the urgency for robust comparat ive randomized researc h given this study is based on weake r observat iona l evidence that is confounded by select ion bias and confounded. However this was a stronger study that used statistical adjustment and propensity score matching. Thus this study suggests caution with corticosteroid and thus the importance for caut ion by clin icians as to the potential harms of cort icosteroids in th is po pulation. These results , whil e based on weake r methodology , have revea led large estimates of effect, is the stro ngest evidence to date on treatment for ARDS , and brings us closest to the COVID- 19 ARDS patient.

As an engineer I've always liked to understand the mechan ics of how things work so I looked into educating myself about the coronavirus and it's mechanics. (b)(6) I've correlated a possible research route for your organization regarding the prevent ion aspect. A quick overlook on this strategy is the follow ing: Coronaviruses are RNA virnses that typically enter human cells when their glycoproteins bind proteins on the cell surface. In the case of the virus that cau ses SARS , that human pro tein is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At this time , scientists think the novel coronavirns is similar enough to SARS that its entry point is likely ACE2 as well. NIH-001159

So glad you are still heading NIAID - it is comforting that there are experts of your caliber still in the room. And thrilled that the NIAID has done so much to develop rapid timelines for DNA vaccines and that you highlighted that progress in the article, since people call me the "Mother of DNA vaccines,". As a former NIAID Council member, I felt I should write to raise an issue that I am sensitized to as a scientist who is ethnically Chinese while American: Why in the JAMA article was it necessary to state that the first travel-related case to the US was a Chinese man (italics mine) who had visited Wuhan. Did his being Chinese either ethnically or by citizenship affect anything biologically? NIH-001162 

NIH-001163 I ask because not only have many Asian people now encountered increased racism in public places (due to fear that any Asian person is a source of COVID-19), but now that the President is turning this epidemic into additional fear-mongering about "borders" it seems all the more important that scientists do not inadvertently add to "xenophobia" (even though non-white skin does not mean a person is foreign) and do not seem to advance any political perspective.

I know you are probably overwhelmed but hope you might pass this along or suggest a strategy that would be a win-win for us all. We have developed a non-alcohol based formulation that utilizes the nanomolecule nitric oxide (NO). as you know, NO is produced in our body and is our first line of defense against microbes . We have harnessed this in a patented formulation called nitric oxide releasing solution/gel (NORGS). We are focused on the development of products for chronic sinusitis, diabetic foot wounds, warts and toenail fungus. However, internally & personally, we have been using NORGS as an extremely effective natural hand sanitizer and nasal spray to protect ourselves from the common cold and flu for years. There are strong independen t published research that NO is antiviral against Corona viral species. We hae data showing definite virucidal characteristics and moderate antiviral effects in host cells. NIH-001168 

With the recent concern w ith COVID-19, we felt we should try to rapidly test the hand rub and nasal spray against the COVID-19 but need to collaborate with a laboratory that could test this fo r us. Funding collaborators are welcome too, as this was not in our budget but we feel a social responsibility to move this forward .

Fauci and Redfield, Scientists in my laboratory at Columbia Un iversity are actively engaged in design strategies to cope with the new strain of corona virus, 20 l 9-nCo V, which has caused a global public health emergency. We have embarked on a project entitled "Nuc leotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases". We provide a summary of this work below. Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019- nCo V, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a simil ar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir /Velpa tasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV . To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we fmther describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by comb ining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3 '-blockin g groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminator s. Please let me know if you would like to receive the full manusc ript. Thank you very much for your consideration . NIH-001178

Commu nicating that influenza will kill more Amer icans than SARS-2 hasn't gained traction.

Why not allow early use of a vaccine that has passed a phase 1 safety testing, similar to what was done for the Ebola vaccines. If a vaccine is shown to be reasonably safe, why not allow its use it in more at-risk people (elderly , smokers) before phase 2 trials are finished . It could also be helpfu l as with the Ebola vaccines to prevent transmission in hot spots of community acquired infections. There doesn't seem to be much downside compa red to the potential for preventing many more deaths than was seen in the Ebola situation. Sincerely yours, Bill Buikema William J.

Here's a link to a non-technical exp lanation of the paper I shared with you earlier: https:// insights.som.yale.edu/insights/new-outbreaks-of-coronavirus-can-bc-halted-,vith-isolation-measures￾according-to-study I have seen predictions stating that upwards of 30% of the world's popu lation will be infected , but I don't see this happening. What I do see are lots of local outbreaks from imported cases, some larger than others, but all heading towards containment. I find Israel to be an interesting test case. A group of infected Korean tourists who visited the country only tested positive for coronavirus after their re turn to Korea, joining the large outbreak that has been reported there. The itinerary of their travel group has been made public so that retrospectively, [sraeli public health officials could ascertain who was exposed where and when (see https://www .hea ltb.gov.il/English/News and Events/Spokespersons Messages/Page s/23022020 J .aspx). Already 1,600 Israelis have been quarantined on account of possible exposure. It has been twelve days since this group of tourists returned to Korea , and no new infect ions have been reported in Israel associated with this group (there are two Israelis who were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and one infected while in ltaly). See https://www .ynetn ews.com/artic1e/H l nXPa7E8 . lt will be interesting (and important) to see how many new infections are detected in the days ahead, and if such new infections are found among those already under preventive watch. Nonetheless I totally concur with preparing as if major tran smission will occur. Much better to err by over- rather than under- preparing (a familiar perspect ive from those bygone smallpox debates). Finally, a reporter asked me yesterday afternoon what I wanted the President to say last n.ight. Here was my response : In a sober way summaiize the facts of lhe outbreak, state that the US has an excellent preparedness team between CDC and NIH, that at the advice of this team travel restriction s and quarantine measures have already been enact.ed, but as of now the public is at very low risk of infection. Still, citizens should go to cdc.gov now to learn from our experts how to prepare in the event that more extreme measures are needed, stay abreast of the situation here and abroad and follow the advice of our experts , get a flu shot(!), and know that the US has a very strong public health system that can withstand this cha llenge . Anyway,just wanted to share all this with you.

Subject: Coronavirus containment modeling Dear Dr. Fauci, It has been many years since we corresponded regarding smallpox bioten-orism and vaccinat ion control. The attached paper on containing a commun ity coronavirus outbreak from a few initial cases via isolation and quarantine might interest you. The news is mostly good - isolation and quarantine can get the transmission rate below epidemic threshold - bur the key is rapid detection of infected persons. Also discussed are some ideas for alleviating congestion in the hospital. ! hope that you find it helpful. Best, Ed Kaplan Edward H. Kaplan, Ph.D. William N. and Marie A.

The health and safety of our meeting attendees and speakers is our top priority , and we are carefully monitoring the coronavirus situation around the world to ensure we take the necessary precautions as recommended by healthcare providers and public health organizations . Currently, your meet ing will proceed as scheduled, and we will contact you immediately if anyth ing changes. Decisions will be made on a moment to moment basis, as new information becomes available . We assure you that the leadership team at Keystone Symposia is closely monitoring global developments and will take swift action to ensure the health and safety of all meeting participants . As a speaker, you hold a very special role at the meeting as a field leader. We very much appreciate your contribution to both the scientific program, and the community of luminary scientists who will convene to direct the future of the field. Your presentation will be a highlight for many attendees, and your insights will inspire others to take on new and innovative directions in their own work . This is the essence of Keystone Symposia -- convening communities of leading scientists to inspire each other to advance biomed icine, and this would not be possible without your engagement . We realize the current situation may add some inconveniences to travel at this time, but we also remind you that each and every one of our speakers is hand-selected by a committee of the world's leading experts to represent their field at the meeting . You are among a very select few to receive this honor. 

The meeting organizers, and our team at Keystone Symposia, have put a great deal oftime and effort over the last tw o years into designing th e program, and your presentation is a key part of that. We hope you will take these though ts into consideration as the meeting approaches. While th is is a t ime we must all be vigilant about publ ic health measures, we are remind ing conference attendees that this is also a time to remain calm, rat ional and scient ific in addressing the situatio n. We encourage you to engage with your fello w colleagues at the meeting as you normally would, to forge new collaborations and novel ideas that w ill dri ve your research and the field in innovative and fruitfu l directions . At the meet ing, we are prov iding the follo w ing suggestions based on recommendations from t he National Foundation of Infect ious Disease: • The best way to protect yourself aga inst COVID-19 is similar to how you would take precautions against the cold or flu. Wash your hands of ten using soap and wate r for at least 20 seconds. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or the crook of your elbow rather than your hands. • There is no need to wear a face mask if you are well and do not have symptoms- masks protect the sick from spread ing germs but wi ll not prevent you from gett ing sick. • Do not assume that anyone of Asian descent is more likely to have coronavirus- do not forget about the importance of inclusivity and evidence-based information. Again, we thank you for your contributions and commitment to Keystone Symposia and wish for a very successful and inspiring meet ing. Sincerely, (b)( 6) Debora h L.

We had the opporttmity to meet in Madrid during the R4P meeting. I was the local chair of the Confe rence and had the privilege of introducing your talk to the plenary. I would like lo invite you as plenary speaker to the meeting of the Spanish AIDS Society (GESIDA) that will take place in Malaga , Spa in next 30th November 2020. GESIDA Congress is the most important HIV national meetings in Spain that brings together the full "HIV Community" including clinicians , basic researchers , experts in epidemiology and public health and member from NGOs and patien ts' associa tions. Overall 700 attendees are expected to come to the meeting. We would love to have you as a speaker in the Opening Plenary Session in evening the 30th November. Your challenging articles regarding the strategies to end the HIV epidemic in the United States, will be a great topic to be addressed in such session and an inspiration to Spanish researchers. If you prefer to talk about a different top ic as the co-morbid ities scenar io in HIV infection it will be welcome too. We would be more than happy if you could participate in this meeting . If know your agenda is always full, even more these days with the current Coronavirus outbreak , NIH-001209 

NIH-001210 but if you could accept this invitation I think this can represent a real boost in the fight against HIV epidem ics in Spain, a field in which the Spanish AIDS Society is strongly committed . It would we wonderful if we can have you as a speaker.

Wednesday, April 22 - Breakfast NIH-001211 

Tuesday, April 28- Breakfast or lunch Tuesday, May 5 - Breakfast or Lunch Friday, May 15 - Lunch Additionally, I have attached an invitation letter from Mr. Rubenstein to Dr. Fauci for your convenience. The Economic Club has the ability to turn around an event in a relatively short period of time. As you may recall, our events typically take place at breakfast, lunch or dinner, at downtown Washington, D.C. hotels. Events that feature a prominen t world leader, such as Dr. Fauci, generally attract a select audience of over 500 members and guests from among Washington 's business and government leaders, as well as the diplomatic corps. We understand the complexities and constraints of Dr. Fauci's schedule and can be responsive to his needs. If none of the dates above work with Dr. Fauci's schedule, please suggest some that will and we wil l work with David to confirm a date and begin the process.

I try to expand on these problems in the article below. I would welcome your response to my thesis.

NIH-001216 In their Medical Virology text published in 1994, 0 .0 . White and F.J. Fenner stated "No convincing evidence has yet been obtained to link human coronaviruses with serious disease ... , but they are an important cause of that trivial but annoying disease, the common cold." This generalization changed drastically with the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2002-2003 (SARS-CoV), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) immediately sought the expertise of these two scientists at the time. Now, 17 years later, we still do not have an antiviral medicine or a vaccine against the novel coronavirus that originated in China, now designated as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). On February 21, there were 75,567 cases and 2,239 deaths in China; and 1,152 cases outside China, with 8 deaths, according to the Director￾General of the WHO. The two viruses appear to use the same gate (or "receptor") on host cells to infect them. Despite such expected similarities between new and old strains of the viru s, research on coronaviruses has not been a priority for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In the end, all that the Director of NIAID was able offer is "good healthcare" as a remedy for COVID￾19 infections. The major reason we do not have a cure for coronaviruses is that there has been no coordinated effort by the NIAID to establish long-term research programs focused on coronaviruses . Realizing the insufficient progress in this area, the NIAID announced on February 6 a "Notice of Special Interest to highlight the urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus." Grants have indeed been awarded to some scientists since 2003, but such grants are highly competitive, with success rates of applications to NIAID between 14 and 18%, indicating that 82-86% of applicants are unable to obtain funding to carry out research. The time and effort spent on preparing grant applications to NIH are enormous, diverting these precious resources from actual research to what some scientists call "grantsmanship" (essentially, the ability to sell your idea to a review committee!). These "games scientist play" to procure funding are a hindrance to the progress of science. The fact that we do not have a cure or a vaccine against coronaviruses over the past 17 years since the SARS epidemic, attests to this detrimental effect . Development of a vaccine against COVJD-19t is also not straightforward. SARS was probably not considered by NIH to be an important pathogen on which to 

NIH-001217 spend resources. Even if the biomedical research community had developed a vaccine against coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies would probably not have considered it a profitable endeavor. Therefore, it is essential for public funds to be used by NIH and the CDC to both discover an effective vaccine and to manufacture it. We need to ensure that long-term projects to develop antivirals and vaccines against coronaviruses and other infectious agents, including tuberculosis and influenza virus, are implemented and fully funded. We need to have a funding system that does not depend on the often unfounded criticism or whims of grant reviewers . Although the current peer review system is touted generally as the best way to allocate funding , it has never been tested scientifically against an alternative. While half of the NIH budget (currently $39 billion) may still be allocated for high-cost projects, including clinical trials , the other half should be awarded for periods of 10 years or longer to established scientists who have a track-record of scientific work, as well as to young scientists who are starting their first independent position . The budgets of these grants would be somewhat limited, but would provide uninterrupted funding and alleviate the stress of competing for renewals every 3-5 years. Scientists opting for these grants will not have to submit extensive grant applications. More importantly , this system will more than double the number of independent investigators . After a 10-12 year period, the scientific productivity (per grant dollar) of scientists on the classical grant system would be compared with that of scientists on long-term funding. After all, the way we choose the mode of science funding should conform to the way science progresses , by experimentation and analysis .

In light of this linked to the fact that our annual meet ing begins March 13 in Philadelphia, we have made the decision to have a 45-60 minute session in the main hall on Saturday (March 14) morning from 7:00-8:00 prior to the scheduled plenary session slated to start at 8:15. My question is whether you would consider taking the Acela up Friday evening returning Saturday morning to host this session w ith a presentation followed by a Q&A session. If that is not possible, would you be willing to provide a 10-15 minute (shorter if you deem that appropriate) video generated as close to the 14th as possible that we would have projected in the main hall as noted above. If the latter, would you have a suggestion of an ID person in Philadelphia who would be knowledgeable and could field questions following your video. I recognize that even if you are willing to come to Philadelphia, that circumstances could arise that would preclude you r traveling in which case we would ask for a video if at all possible . Finally, if neither option is possible, is there somebody in DC (includ ing NIH), Baltimore or Philadelphia who could provide the short review and then sit for 30-45 minutes of Q&A. I am well aware that this is last minute and you have been incredibly busy with issues related to th e pandemic, any help you could provide would be much appreciated by my colleagues and me.

As you may know, the IMF publ ishes forecasts of economic growth for member countries four ti mes a year, as well as macroeconomic policy recommendations. In that context, it would be invaluable for us to hear public health experts' views on the likely trajectory of the virus-the number of people that are likely to get infected in different countries and the likely time path. We would also benefit from hearing experts' views on the optimal public health policy response in different types of countries (countries w ith stronger or weaker health systems, different development levels, etc.), and the implied resource needs. We are planning to set up a conference call with several experts to discuss these issues and were wondering if you would be available to join us.

The text of the OpEd is below in blue font (scroll down). I am sure the WSJ will shorten it and edit it but at least you have an advance copy of it. I just wanted you to have it since the WSJ is read widely in DC and I don't want anyone blindsiding you with questions about it. As you know I have been long proponent of passive antibody therapies in infectious diseases and there is a huge body of historical data support ing this approach. Certainly, with modern blood banking techniques this option can be made quite safe and administration of a few cc's of serum could confer immediate immun ity to those who will be exposed - like ER staff . I hope you agree with the message and like it. Thank you for all you are doing for the country and humanity . If you need me for anything in this crisis rest assured that I am here.

Dear Mr. Varadara jan, NIH-001257 

I wonder if the WSJ is interested in my Op Ed. I am trying to get a message out that conva lescent serum (e.g. serum from people who recover) can be used to stem the coronavirus epidemic if administered to exposed people. This has been known for over a century, and is well accepted, but not wide ly known, even among experts today. There was one report that China was beg inning to stockpile serum but there has been almost no discuss ion of this option among world public health authorities . Although I can get this published in a medical journal my hope is to publish it instead in a venue of high readership since this is something that can be done today to stem the epidemic. I am hoping that given the econom ic consequences of the outbreak that the WSJ is interested . I included a brief bio below. Thanks for looking at this. Arturo Prop osed op-ed.

They are thus hinting that this is the reason why there was such an explos ion of infections in China. This is possible, but the lowest level was in Northern Ltalians and take a look at what is happening in Nort hern Ttaly. I do not mean to put the paper down since there may be some truth in it.

The Secretary has charged my office to lead efforts across the Department to prepare and defend our health care system during the novel coronavirus outbreak through the Health Care System Resilience Task Force.

Now, we must build on that knowledge to expedite and execute a whole of HHS response to support protection of the health care system that spans public health, health care, and human services. Please join Dr. Kevin Yeskey, ASPR's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC's Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respirato ry Diseases, on Wednesday, March 4 from 9:00 AM -10:15 AM, at the O'Neill House Office Building for a working session to align current activities and next steps to be executed as part of a coordinated HHS response to COVID-19.

It would be great if you could tweet to your many Twitter followers that although the current risk of coronavirus to the American public is low, t he fact that there is community spread of virus in a number of countries besides China and including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran among others poses a risk that we may progress to a global pandemic of COVID-19. If that occurs we will surely have many more cases in the USA. And so for that reason, the American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures that include social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc. There is nothing to be done right now since there are so few cases in this country and these cases are being prope rly isolated, and so go about your daily business.

Gene-RADAR platform for Real time Mobile (POC) Coronavirus detection/ viral load monitoring / Followup to our meeting at the ASPEN ideas festival - Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci, It was a great pleasure meeting you all a couple of years ago when we were both speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Some of my contacts at the CDC recently briefed me about the rapidly emerging threat of the coronavirus to the US and have been urging us to develop an app for detecting coronavirus with high sensitivity and specificity on our Gene-RADAR platform . Our platform has the ability to quantify viral loads in 'real-time' which would be a much more precise and accurate solution in deciding quarantine than the current thermometers or even the current CDC coronavirus test which has a very poor Limit of detection (ie low sensitivity). We have a strong track record of responding to previous pandemic threats and rapidly building Gene RADAR applications for Ebola and Zika and then getting them through clinical validation as per the the FDA EUA approval process. Our Gene-RADAR Zika test was FDA EUA certified right as the Zika crisis was coming to an end. I would love to work with you to see how we can help in your efforts to rapidly respond to this deadly threat to the US and the world. Here are some of the capabilities of our platform that we believe could be an enabler for helping to stop this out break from becoming a full-fledged global pandemic. NIH-001278 

• Gene-RADAR platfo rm for Real time Mobile (POC) Coronavirus detection/ viral load monitoring o Highly sensitive and specific - minimize false positives and false negatives o With very good LOD's we could potent ially start to catch people presymptomatically and enable the early detection, early quaranti ne would limit the spread and early intervention could lead to better outcomes o More precise viral load monitoring could help determine when to release people from quarantine or ICU beds o Our platform's ability to quantify vial loads could change clinical trial endpoints for new drug candidates or (repurposed drug formulation s), thereby accelerating FDA approvals for novel therapeutic regimen o We already have an ISO 13485 certified manufactur ing facility (currently in Boston) that we are prepared to move as fast as possible to ramp up our production We would love to work with you to repurpose our FDA approved platform for the above coronav irus applications assay and help your noble efforts to stop th is outb reak from becoming a full blown global pandemic that could costs thousands of lives and cause trillions of dollars of economic damage to the global economy. We would love to speak with you to brief on our capabilit ies and discuss how we can qualify for some of the emergency funding being made available to help tackle this pandemic threa t .

Dr. Fauci has been a wonderfu l speaker for us in the past, and I'm reaching out to him today for a discussion on coronavirus.

NIH-001296 This is something we would do in our stud io at our office near Dupont Circle. We normally do them for 45-60 minutes, and we take questions (visa Twitter) from our audience. The audience would be reporters who cover the topic, as well as others interested in the topic . It is a way to have an in-depth, thoughtful conversation about a pressing topic. Here are a couple we've done (the first is on Zika a few years ago): Zika panel discussion: https://nationalpress .org/topic/understanding -the -zika￾threat/?st =O&t=&mm=Video Ted Koppel: https ://nat ionalpress.org/ t oolbox-topic/ lights-out -risks-t o-t he-power - grid/?st = 7042&mm =Video Autonomous vehicles panel discussion: https://nat ionalpress.org/top ic/wha ts-new-wit h￾autonomous -vehicles/?st=8474&t=Automat ion&mm =Story We'd like to do one of these on coronavirus . We'd love to have Dr. Fauci as our prime guest. We can schedule it around his demands, but would of course love to do it as soon as possible. We know he is in demand at this moment. But he is such a singular expert on the topic we'd love to have a discussion with him - one that would help get his message out to journalists (and others) who need to be informed to best cover the topic. Is it possible to check with Dr. Fauci to see if this is possible? Thanks, Chris Adams National Press Foundation

Dear Nehal, With the coronavirus border ing on a pandemic and the expectat ion that it will affect the US at some point, it seems to me we should be prepared to provide guidance to patients who are on immune modulators for inflammatory disease. Specifically, many will wonder if patients should stop th eir biologic if the virus becomes prevalent in their commun ity. There will also be questions about stopping biologics in the setting of acute infectio n with coronavirus. Any thoughts on this? My specific interests relates to patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthr itis on biologics but it's also relevant to patients with IBD, RA and other inflammatory diseases. Joel Joel M.

NIH-001338 Hi Tony, I'm sure you know Michael Milken. I've worked with him over many years, and though he is a somewhat controversial figure he has certainly helped NIH in many ways. He reached out to me last night to ask if there is anything he could do to help with the coronavirus vaccine effort. He had seen press reports that finding a pharma partner had been challenging - and wanted to volunteer his help in that regard, since he has deep connections in the private sector. He also said that he'd be glad to help with any philanthropic needs, both through his own resources and his influence over members of the Giving Pledge. Are there useful actions that I can suggest to him? FC

I 'm Sorry to bother you as you must be very busy. I noticed your comment about coronavirus on American media, I deeply hope you could answer few of my questions.Your answers will be very helpful to me. The questions are below. Thank you very much! Sincerly , Paul Xin 1/You said on CNN that US have had pandemic preparedness plan that developed in preparation for pandemic influenza . Could you provide some detai ls of this plan? The plan outlines the differences between containment and mitigation. It speaks of the thing that should be done if an outbreak occurs in the USA. Thes inclue social distancing, use of telecommunication and telework, temporarily closing schools, avoiding crowed places such as indoor arenas and theaters. 2/To prepare for potent ial communities spread of coronavirus in US, do you thin k that US need take the measures similar with China? China was in the "reactive " mode of responding to an explosion of cases in Wuhan City and Hubei province with spread throughout China. China had to resort to very dramatic measures such as shutting down cities. The USA is now in a preparative mode and not a reactive mode and so our response is much different than that of China.

From: Sent: To: Subject : Jon: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E) Wed, 26 Feb 2020 01:32:22 +0000 Jon LaPook RE: CBS Sunday Morning The message would have to be that the situat ion continues to evolve and people need to follow the news and the reports from CDC. For example , a few weeks ago if you wanted to travel to Japan or South Korea , it was fine since there were few is any cases there. Now both cotmtries have a travel alert that says "Avoid all but essential travel". You should tell people that travel to places with few or no reported cases is fine. Only when you have community spread (person to person to person) shou ld you be concerned about a specific travel destination. Also , you could explain to people that pandemics evolve when a new infectious disease is spreading by sustained community spread in multiple countries in different regions of the globe. Once a [)andemic erupts. it is virtually impossible for any country to be free of cases. Peop le need to understand that. You can mitigate the effects, but you cannot avoid having infections since you cannot shut off the country from the rest of the world. Also, you need to speak of the real and present danger of seasonal influenza every year. Do not let the fear of the unknown (i.e. a pandemic of a new infectious agent) distor t your evaluation of the 1isk of the pandemic to you relative to the risks that you face every day. The only thing that we can do is to prepare as best as possible and do not yield to wrreasonable fear.

On Feb 25, 2020, at 4:48 PM, McNeil Jr, Donald G <mcnei l@nytimes.com>w rote : I was just watching the HHS briefing online, and thinking about an article I read this morning , and Bruce Aylward's description of what he saw in China, and a lot of videos I've watched on the South China Morning Post website (they're doing great coverage .). In China, we in the med ia tend to report the horr ors and the lockdown and the governme nt's early lies ... But the truth is that a lot of average Chinese behaved incredibly heroically in the face of the virus: 25,000 doctors and nurses wen t into Wuhan to help, knowing they might die. Average people gave up their stockpiles of masks so they could be shipped to Wuhan . Ne ighborhood committees brought food to thousands of little old ladies and checked on them eve ry day, even as they asked them to stay behind their doors for fear of infection. Meanwhile , in America, people tend to act like selfish pigs interested only in saving themselves. How can I hoard a mask? Where's my vaccine? This morning , I read this appa lling article from Alabama . Here you have Americans com ing back from a horrifying experience overseas, and the President -- who is popula r in Alabama -- asks Alabama ns to take some of those fell ow Amer icans in. There is zero risk because they're going to be housed on a naval base. And yet, the answer is "No! Keep them out!" And their legislators encourage it.. .. I dunno -- that's the kind of behavior I expect from my fellow New Yorker s, not from Alabama. If the virus arrives -- and we both know it wilJ -- America is going to have to do better than that. Like the Chinese, Americans are going to have to look out for each other the way we haven't since 9/ 11. Or maybe since World War II. But that's not the tone of the HHS briefings . They're an aggressive, defensiv e, almost smart-alecky "we got this" tone. The only time the tone was right when you NIH-001345 

NIH-001346 were the third to take the mike and explain things to that kid shouting from the back without a mike about "What's the real message? What do we do?" Maybe there could be some thought given to mentally preparing Americans to work together in the face of the crisis? Quarantines are a very aggressive approach -- but they require a lot of compassion or the people quarantined suffer. I might get around to writing an article about this, but my editors keep grabbing me for minute by minute stuff and I'm way behind. Donald

Ari is also calling me frequently . The virus has adapted itself very well to humans with considerable community transmission (certainly in China) now in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, etc. If it continues to spread via multiple generations of human to human transmission, then we will not be able to avoid considerable amounts of infect ions and spread in the USA. Seasonal influenza has a mortality of 0.1%. The calculated mortality of COVID-19 to about 2.5 %. It is probably lower since the denominator is likely larger than we appreciate due to asymptomatic infections . Even if the mortality goes down to 0.5%, that is still equivalent to a pandemic influenza of 1957 or 1968. In other words, it could be worse than you think. Tony Anthony S.

I wanted to follow up to let you know that Yasmine Belkaid and Ian Myles-whose work we discussed on host-microbe interactions and developing a bacteria-based treatment for eczema, respectively-are willing to meet with you on Feb. 28. Here are links to some background info: • Dr. Belkaid's lab page, and recent NIAID press release about a skin microbiome study from her lab • Dr. Myles' lab page, and NIAID press release about findings from a Ph 1/2 trial assessing the R. mucosa treatment for eczema Dr. Belkaid is available at 1 :30pm (her building is next to the Clinical Center, where you'll be meeting with Julie Segre I believe from 12-1ish). Dr. Myles' schedule is a bit more flexible, and he's currently available to meet either in the morning before you speak with Dr. Fauci or later in the afternoon after Dr. Belkaid (Dr. Myles is in the Clinical Center, about a 5 min walk from Dr. Fauci's building)- let me know if you have a timing preference. We can firm up times a bit closer to the date, but wanted to give you an update. NIH-001392

NIH-001416 Madonna 's Secret for Longevity Seen Aiding Bacteria Boom: Health 2012-05-08 21 :34:07 .963 GMT By Kaneko Matsuyama and Jason Gale May 9 (Bloomberg) -- The secret to Madonna's staying power may be surprisingly simple: gardening. What the pop star does involves no trowel or soil. Thanks to dishes of fermented soy beans, millet and brown rice prepared by her personal chef, Mayumi Nishimura , Madonna practices a form of inner horticulture -- cultivating her intestinal flora in a burgeoning alternative approach to health. Studies of the trillions of bacteria living on and in the body suggest the Material Girl, 53, may be onto something. By eating foods rich in fiber and laced with so-called good 

NIH-001417 bacteria , she may be encouraging helpful microbes to flourish in her bowel, aiding in food digestion and vitamin extraction and possibly staving off diseases from asthma to colon cancer . "This diet that Madonna is following is very sensible, " says David Topping, chief food￾nutrition researcher at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Adelaide, who studied gut biology for 25 years . "The bacteria that live inside you are fulfilling very important functions ." While scientists try to understand the ecology of the bacteria and their interactions with diet and disease , companies are looking for ways to profit. The health benefits of gut germs have spawned a global market for products 

NIH-001418 that contain friendly bacteria , called probiotics , in the form of tablets or supplements added to foods by companies including Danone, Nestle SA, and Yakult Honsha Co. The market for supplemented dairy products such as Danone's Activia yoghurts and Yakult's fermented drinks , worth $14.7 billion six years ago, will probably expand 32 percent to $33.5 billion by 2016 , Euromonitor International estimated last month. Quinoa, Not Coffee Studies published in the past year have linked certain bowel-dwelling bacteria to a stronger immune system , while others have been associated with autism and obesity. In one paper published in the journal Nature, scientists showed that a type of white blood 

NIH-001419 cell that produces antibodies only acquired its infection-fighting ability after spending time in the gut. Nishimura, who has cooked for cancer patients before being hired by Madonna , serves quinoa and other whole grains as staples , along with vegetables and soy sauce, she said in a telephone interview from New York. She also tries to offer seaweed every second day -- usually sauteed or boiled. "We eat food processed as little as possible ," Nishimura, 55 , says of her dietary approach , known as macrobiotic. She doesn't recommend meat, dairy and coffee. An agent for Madonna didn't respond to a request for comment. Whole grains and fiber act as both food and fertilizer to the bacteria in the bowel, according to Mark Morrison , a 

NIH-001420 microbiologist with Australia's CSIRO in Brisbane studying ways to improve gut function and health. 'Terrific Interest' There are 10 times as many bacteria in the human intestinal tract as there are cells in the body. As coordinator of the Human Microbiome Project, Lita Proctor is helping to organize collaboration from hundreds of scientists around the world trying to map and study microbial communities living on the skin, in the mouth and bowel, and in other parts of the body. "It's extremely heartening and healthy to have so much attention now paid to the diet ," says Proctor, who works at the National Human Genome Institute in Bethesda, Maryland . Even so, Proctor says the research is still in its infancy, and products based 

NIH-001421 on partial understanding may not deliver what they promise . "That's not holding up the industry ," she says. "It's a very fluid , ill-defined area, but with a lot of terrific interest." Flowers and Weeds The term probiotic is vague and there's no accepted definition for it. Measuring results may be even more of a grey area and some supplements are destroyed by stomach acid before entering the gut, according to Proctor. Nishimura relies on fermented foods such as miso, soy sauce and tempeh to play the role of probiotics and says the benefits of her diet can be quickly noticed. "I feel better than I did 20 years ago," Madonna wrote in a preface to the cookbook her chef had published in 2010. "I am 

NIH-001422 very grateful to you for this." The garden analogy is helpful when it comes to describing the complex ecology of the bacteria living on humans, says Julie Segre, the lead investigator working on the skin microbiome at the National Human Genome Research Institute. "There are some flowers that make it easier for other flowers to grow in the same soil," Segre says. The most important thing is to keep out the invasive weeds, she says. 'Transpoosions ' When the weeds take over, Australian gastroenterologist Thomas Borody has a radical approach to reestablishing the balance of intestinal flora in his patients: he transplants fecal germs from disease-free individuals directly into the upper reach of the colon , in a pouch 

NIH-001423 known as the cecum. His Sydney clinic has done 1,800 of the procedures , which he jokingly dubs "transpoosions ," over 25 years. Borody , 62, says the treatment has helped patients with ailments ranging from autism to pseudomembranou s colitis, a resilient infection that causes abdominal pain, loose bowel movements and fever. "The next day their diarrhea stops," the doctor says . After the procedure , he asks patients to avoid treatments that may damage their gut flora. Three studies presented at the American College of Gastroenterology 's meeting in October indicate fecal transplants can help with bouts of diarrhea associated with the bacterium Clostridium difficile. 

NIH-001424 When Weeds Take Over Keeping inner bugs healthy is crucial because otherwise they risk taking over more than the garden . If intestinal bacteria aren't able to survive on the food their host consumes , the germs will try to feed on what they can find -- "mucus as well as anything else," according to CSIRO's Topping. That may lead to inflammatory bowel disease, a painful condition that can evolve into colon cancer , he says . Staving off disease is one reason people have turned to Nishimura 's cooking in the past. The chef, who prepared meals for cancer patients in Boston, says the diet helps with constipation, menstrual pain and body odor. When she first changed the way she ate, Nishimura says she also found that her 

NIH-001425 allergic skin rash improved . 'So Fresh' Typically, Nishimura tailors her meals each day to suit the way her employer feels , she says, adding that Madonna prefers the chef herself to shop for ingredients. Popular dishes include seaweed in miso soup; hijiki -- a type of brown seaweed - served with carrots and onions and seasoned with soy sauce; and cooked oats for breakfast , Nishimura says. Whole grains demand harder work for bowel bacteria , which help the body extract vitamins and nutrients from food, because the insoluble fiber they contain is only broken down in the lower reaches of the digestive tract in a fermentation process that delivers different quantities and varieties of inflammation -

NIH-001426 fighting short-chain fatty acids to the body's cells. There is "solid evidence" that microbes play a role in tuning the immune system , says Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health, where scientists showed in January that children with autism and gastrointestinal disturbances have a bacterial species not found in non￾autistic children with tummy upsets. Madonna and others making similar diet choices may not know they're pushing the science frontier. They may just feel better. "When you cut out animal products, white sugar and coffee for 10 days you start to feel the difference ," Nishimura said. "When I first began 

NIH-001427 this diet, I remember how my head became clearer, I woke up earlier and felt so fresh in the morning that I didn't want to stay in bed." Madonna herself isn't lacking in stamina . Her world tour, which starts in Tel Aviv this month and ends next March , includes 75 concerts in Europe and North America . Her previous world tour was in 2008 and 2009 , when she also published six children's books and directed or produced two movies .

My beat is science and technology. Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, I'm covering feature stories about the outbreak, hoping to explain to readers what it is, especially since the virus is evolving daily at an unexpected high speed, and in so many confusing ways. Now in China we are getting conflicting information about the new virus and thus become confused about it. For example, we are seeing more and more cases that a patient with negative test results for 2 non-continuous days, still infected with the virus and tested positive afterwards. It makes the treatment really difficult because it seems hard to determine whether the patient is fully cured or not. Since you are an experienced immunologist, I'm wondering if you could share your insights with the Chinese readers and take an interview . The Interview could be via phone or email, whichever works fine for you. NIH-001447 

If possible, I'd love to send you the questions before we talk. Since we have time difference, I might not be available during the early afternoon (your time) but I could make it in the morning, noon and maybe late in the afternoon and evening (your time). I'm sorry for bothering you on this subject, but we face severe difficulty in understanding this new virus and taking measures properly. We have quite limited sources and perspectives for understanding this new virus . However, as a science reporter, I believe in a crisis of public health, the informat ion is the key for the public. They should have the opportunity to hear more perspectives from different specialists. Since you are experienced in fighting against so many viruses, especially SARS, I believe your opinions wi ll be inspiring to the readers. It would be of great help and great honor for us to invite you for an interview. A phone call interview would be preferred but if time doesn't work for you, is it possible for you to reply via email? I'll list all the questions in deta il. I could be reached by Best wishes, Faye The Portrait Beijing, China (b)(6) or ______ Cb_)_C6) _, I'm looking forward to your reply. NIH-001448

We have named it (MRl to MR12) . we are highly interested in MR2 as this mirror DNA sequence is absent in the human genome. (b)(4) I wish to add here there are few studies which state that mirror DNA has the potentiality to form H-DNA and later has a potent iality to induce mutations.

if not already there. The reason to say this is that when several countries have widespread transmissions, then spill￾over to other countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect increasing world-wide transmissions among progressively more countries. In esse nce, you will be expe1iencing a pandemic. We are not quite there yet, but we are getting disturb ingly close.

Still unclear about aerosol transmission although there are anecdotal reports that this occurs similar to what we saw in individual episodes with SARS back in 2002-2003.

-Sneeze or cough produces respiratory droplet or aerosolized respiratory secretion which make contract with upper or lower respiratory mucosa, which results in infection of human cells. Seems most likely. - What about contact transmission, contaminated hand to conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth - Fecal/oral - transmission to fetus -What are the diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis of novel coronavirus?

If she were coming from Japan or South Korea, which are experiencing an emerging outbreak, I might feel a litt le different, but Singapore has good infection control despite the number of cases in that country Given her history of recent Shingrix vaccination, I would wait another day to see if her fever breaks.

My question is whether there's enough of a concern, viz. the time in Singapore, for her to be tested for covid-19 . If so, what's the best way to conduct the testing? Or is it okay to see if her fever breaks by tomorrow? (You must be getting lots of these questions). Best, Ted NIH-0016 18

This seminar taught the participants how to eliminate the flu with the use of water treatments, ie (steam baths, etc). I have now for these past 40 some-odd years, been taking two treatment 's; one in the evening and another in the middle of the night, whenever I have contacted the flu: AND have had the facilities to do so; and each time I was well the next morning. No temperature, no symptoms whatsoever. With the high rate that this Coronavirus is spreading, one can see what a great tool these treatments can be for medical professionals. To have those who are sick with the flu, complete ly free of all symptoms after two treatments would greatly ease the burden on Dr's and other medical professiona ls AND each facility. NIH-001627

Here is the link to the overall CUGH meeting which provides an overview of the whole conference https ://www .cugh2020 .org/program . As we discussed months ago you agreed to be in the opening day plenary session on April 18th , entitled "Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health Security". The details and other speakers are listed below. I may try to organize a call of all speakers in a month to coordinate talks/topics as the session is 90 minutes with 5 speakers, and a lot of ground to cover, especially with the COVID19 outbreak. NIH-001630 

NIH-001631 Judy Wasserheit, copied here, would also like to invite you to a special session she is organizing on the coronavirus epidemic at the same CUGH conference in a late￾breaker session on Sunday, April 19 (the second day of the conference) from 8:4Sam-10:1Sam at the Washington Hilton Hotel (Monroe Room). This talk would be slightly different from the plenary session and you could expand on COVID19 research prior ities and update on progress. We realize your schedule is very busy but your insights and knowledge on both of these topic s is unparalleled. If you cannot speak at the second session we would appreciate your recommendation as to an alternative who could address this latter topic. Thanks and all the best, Tom Plenary Session Details: Session Day: Saturday, April 18, 2020 Session Time : 11:30am-1:00pm Location: Washington Hilton Hotel, International Ballroom Panel Title: "Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health Security" Short Panel Description: This Plenary Panel will highlight the continual threats of emerging and re-emerging infectiou s diseases, and their impact on global security for surveillance, detection, treatment and prevention of these diseases. Over recent decades, multiple epidemic events have underscored how highly vulnerable we are to viral threat s. Our world is globally connected-and an "emerging threat" in one part of the world can pose a threat everywhere and to everyone. About 75 percent of new human diseases are caused by microbes that originate in animals. These include HIV, influenza (including pandemic HlNl, HSNl , and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah. The recent emergence of COVID from China clearly illustrates the magnitude , rapidity 

NIH-001632 and impact that a new infectious agent can have on global health security. This panel of leading experts will discuss the emergence of these microbial threats, and our ability to detect, respond and prevent future epidemics of these pathogens .

I have drafted proposed responses for his review , also attached. 1. Do you believe that SARS-COV2 is capable of causing a pandemic? Are you expecting many secondary transmissions of the virus outside China? A pandemic is generally defined as sustained transmission of a new pathogen in multiple regions of the world. COVID-19 does not yet meet that definition , and I hope that China and other countries in Asia with some transmission are able to contain the outbreak. However, it is possible that COVID-19 could become a pandemic. It would not be surprising to see additional secondary transmissions of the virus outside of China. 2. Chinese authorities are reporting a decline of new cases. Could we say that the virus has peaked and maybe it will slow down? When are you expecting to have a clearer picture about the evolution of this epidemic? Although the number of daily cases in China appears to have gone down , it is too early to tell if this is really a decline in the outbreak. 3. Could the virus become endemic and give seasonal outbreaks? If China is not able to contain the outbreak, it is possible COVID-19 could become endemic and lead to seasonal outbreaks. However, it is too early to know the likelihood of this scenario. 4. What about its transmissibility? Some experts say that WHO is underestimating it's transmissibility. Could the reality be different maybe because, among other things, many cases stay undetected? Because of the many unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 , it is difficult to make any firm conclusions regarding overall transmissibili ty and severity. However , it appears to be much more transmissible than SARS. Also , there are likely asymptomatic COVID-19 infections that are not getting counted because people do not go to the doctor for testing or treatment if they are not sick. NIH-001636 

NIH-001637 s. Do you believe that the measures taken by China and countries around the world are adequate to stop SARS-COV2 spread? There is a lot of discussion about thermal cameras and travel restrictions for example. China has taken extreme measures to control the outbreak. Restricting the movement of 50 million people is unprecedented. However, it might ultimately have an effect on slowing transmission. Precautions implemented in the U.S. are not intended to detect every person with COVID-19 entering the country. However, our approach has allowed us time to better plan and prepare our health system . 6. What is the key to stop the worldwide spread of the virus? Though we have mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop effective countermea sures, right now, the outbreak response remains focused on the proven public health practices of identifying cases , isolating patients and tracing contacts. 7. In the northern hemisphere we have a flu outbreak - in Greece as well. Some experts say that this is the real danger and not the coronavirus. What is your view? I am always concerned about influenza . Every flu season , millions of people are at risk of getting very sick or dying. Currently people in the U.S. and most countries in the northern hemisphere are at a much higher risk of being exposed to influenza than SARS-CoV-2. However , the COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving situation and we are treating it as a very serious public health threat. 8. Many efforts are being in process for the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus . Are you coordinating any of them and which ones? Are there any efforts more promising than others? Which platforms of vaccine development are more promising? When do you believe that we could have a vaccine available for clinical trials and then for human use? NIAID is exp loring multiple candidates and is on track to test an experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in recipients. It is important to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will likely not be widely available for more than a year. 9. What about therapies? Dozens are being tried - from plasma to herbal medicines in China. Which are the most promising? NIAID is pursuing the development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies for potential use against COVID-19. NIAID is preparing protocols for in vitro and in vivo studies of the antiviral remdesivir, which has shown promise against other coronaviruses in animal models . NIAID also plans to evaluate Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and interferon-beta for their activity against SARS-CoV-2 . In addition, NIAID scientists are working to identify monoclonal antibodies with 

therapeutic potential from stored SARS patient samples as well as COVID-19 patient samples . 10. Are the things we know about this new virus more than the ones we don't know? Which are the main questions about it that remain to be answered? New data are published about SARS-CoV-2 every day. However, we still have a lot to learn. For example, we do not know why there are so few cases among children, which is uncommon for a respiratory virus. 11. How worried should people outside China be about SARS-COV2? What is the biggest danger from this virus? . The risk to the general American public remains low at this time ; however, this could change and that is why we are treating the emergence of a novel coronavirus as a very serious public health threat. We understand that people may be worried . We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their actions. 12. Which are the protective measures anyone should take against the new virus? Do masks work? The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to protect against infection.

NIH-001640 HHS Engages Sanofi's Recombinant Technology for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Vaccine Racing to develop a vaccine against the 2019 novel coronavirus, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response has engaged Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Author ity (BARDA), a component of ASPR, will provide expertise and reallocated funds to support the vaccine's development . Sanofi will use its egg-free, recombinant DNA platform to produce a recombinant 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate. The technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins of the virus . The protein's DNA will be combined with DNA from a virus harmless to humans, and used to rapidly produce large quantities of antigen which stimulate the immune system to protect against the virus . The antigens will be separated and collected from these cells and purified to create working stocks of vaccine for advanced development. "Flexibility and scalability are cornerstones of rapid response to an emerging infectious disease," said BARDA Director Rick A. Bright, Ph.D. "Using this proven technology, we can pivot immediately to address this new global health threat. Our goal is a licensed vaccine to provide long-term health security against this latest virus and prevent future coronavirus outbreaks ." BARDA has worked with Sanofi since 2004 and in 2009 began collaborating with Protein Sciences of Meridian , Connecticut, now owned by Sanofi, to develop a recombinant technology with the flexib ility to make millions of doses of vaccine quickly in an influenza pandemic. In 2016, BARDA added this vaccine to the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. When Sanofi purchased the company and its technology in 2017, BARDA continued working with Sanofi on pandemic vaccine development , and in December 2019 the partners began focusing on increasing manufactu ring capacity for recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States, in accordance with a president ial execut ive order to enhance national security and the public health by modernizing influenza vaccines and technologies . This expanded collaboration with Sanofi is BARDA's second program to focus on developing a novel coronavirus vaccine candidate in the past few weeks. There is currently no approved vaccine, treatment, or diagnostic for novel coronavirus infections; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to enable emergency use of a diagnostic test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. BARDA also is working with counterparts across the government, including within HHS and with the Department of Defense. The team is reviewing potential vaccines, treatments and diagnostics from across the public and private sectors, particularly products in development for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), to identify promising candidates for development and licensure to detect, protect against or treat novel coronavirus infections. To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector that could be used in responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. government 

NIH-001641 launched a single point-of -entry website for innovators and product developers to submit brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or technologies relevant to this new virus. Federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that have progressed into or beyond non-clinical studies, have established large-scale commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, and/or have utilized a platform already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). BARDA also opened an easy broad agency announcement, an EZ-BAA, specific to diagnostics that utilize platforms already cleared by the FDA, with a viable plan to meet requirements for the FDA to consider Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) within 12 weeks of an award. About HHS, ASPR, and BARDA HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans , providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine. public health, and social services. The mission of ASPR is to save lives and protect Americans from 21st century health security threats . Within ASPR, BARDA invests in innovation , advanced research and development , acquisition, and manufacturing of medical countermeasures - vaccines, drugs, therapeutics, diagnostic tools , and non-pharmaceutical products needed to combat health security threats . To date, 54 BARDA-supported products have achieved regulatory approval, licensure or clearance.

Or put differently - your statements and concerns from then mostly coincide with my thinking and wonies now ... :( . So a question - what is your thinking now? Are the hospitals you're affiliated with hiring additiona l staff (yet)? Any personal preparations? Good luck to you and all the best for those close to you, kind regards, Sean Scherer P.S. I guess part of the the reason I'm asking is, because I (a non-institutionally affiliated biologist), am in touch with the university-hospital here (b) ( Germany), but my concerns are so far falling on deaf ears ... But also just reading the paper and seeing others come to the same conclusions - albeit on more theore tical grounds and multip le years ago - made me want to reach out.

Thanks During one call, the CDC's principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, argued against taking the infected Americans on the plane, according to two participants. She noted the U.S. government had already told passengers they would not be evacuated with anyone who was infected or showed symptoms. She was also concerned about infection control. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was also on the calls, recalled saying her points were valid and should be considered. But Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the coronavirus task force, pushed back: Officials had already prepared th e plane to handle passengers who might develop symptoms on the Jong flight, he argued. The two Boeing 74 7s had 18 seats cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. Infectious disease doctors would also be onboard .

Donald Story contains these crucial grafs: In Washington, where it was still Sunday afternoon, a fierce debate broke out: The State Department and a top Trump administration health official wanted to forge ahead. The infected passengers had no symptoms and could be segregated on the plane in a plastic-lined enclosure. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disagreed, contending they could still spread the virus . The CDC believed the 14 should not be flown back with uninfected passengers. "It was like the worst nightmare," said a senior U.S. official involved in the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.

It is impossible to predict at this point if the current outbreak will progress to a true pandemic. The future of this outbreak and whether it will progress to a pandem ic will be determined by two factors: 1) the degree to which China controls infect ions in China, which will ultimately impact how many infect ions leak out to other countries in the world. 2) The success or not of other countries that have received travel-related cases from China in preventing the development of sustained transmission of infections in their own country. If these other countries are successful in containing the transmissions, then a pandemic will be avoided.

NIH-001709 

I CAUTION: EXTERNAL SENDER Joel: There are many iteration s of the definition of a "pandemic" . However, one that I use that is simple and under standable is as follows: An outbreak of a serious infectious disease with substantial global health consequences (usually one that has never before been experienced by the human populat ion) that is transmitted readily from person to person and where there is sustained transmission (i.e. multiple generations of person to person to person) in multiple countries and regions of the world. In this regard, the coronavirus outbreak in China is an "epidemic" in China, but it is not yet a pandemic since there is not "sustained" person to person transmission throughout the world. There are infections in other countries (more than 25 countries), but these started as travel related cases from China and although there are several human to human infections in these other countries, these infections have not yet been "sustained". If we start seeing sustained, multiple generations of transmissions in many countries throughout the world, then the outbreak will have progressed to fill the criteria of a true pandemic. Hope that this is helpful. Best regards, Tony Anthony S.

From: Michael Gerson (b)(6)> Sent: Thursda y, February 20, 2020 11:04 AM ------~~ To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E] (b)(6) Subject: Tony, I'm still working on this, but need your reaction Meanwhile , on the other side of the earth, th ere have been 73,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 2000 deaths. This leaves American hea lth experts hoping that the number of infections has been dramatically underreported. That is not a typo. If the current nu1nbers are close to accurate, it indicates a coronavirus mortality rate upwards of 2 percent. The morality rate for the seasonable flu is generally .1 percent. The mortality rate for pandemic flu is .3 percent. The particularly deadly flu pandemic of 1918 - NIH-001714 

NIH-001715 which took the lives of more than 100 million people around the world - had a mortality rate of 1.8 to 2 percent. So, if 2000 deaths is the numerator, scientists hope that the denominator is actually much larger. And that is probable, given the likelihood that there are many more people who have the infection but don't know it, or are not showing symptoms. The good news? The outbreak started in a single location and seems largely contained there. There have been several hundred cases in more than 25 countries outside of China. But the overwhelming majority have been travel related. The containment measures of Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan - which have the most cases - seem to have been successful. Of the 15 American cases (before the arrival of the cruise ship passengers), 13 are travel related. The two others are spouses of people in that group. We still have not seen widespread, sustained transmission from person to person outside of China. The Chinese reaction to the virus has shown the weaknesses and advantages of authoritarianism. The immediate response of a system built on fear is to a problem like this one is denial and deception. No one wants to carry bad news. So local Chinese officials spent the first week of the outbreak - as the disease was spreading under the radar - insisting that the transmission of the virus was all animal to human. But only in a society like China could you have the effective lockdown of 50 million people, including the entire city of Wuhan, to slow the spread of the disease. Public health officials in most places - who are required to balance health needs with civil liberties - would not even consider such a measure. Yet it appears to be working. The danger? "All that is needed is for a few countries in the developing world that can't contain the coronavirus," Tony Fauci told me. "This could be the second wave of the pandemic." Pandemic diseases tend to attack the weakest links - the most vulnerable health systems - in the global chain. If there is sustained transmission in those places , says Fauci , "even countries with best practices will suffer." Countries in Africa are of particular concern. There are millions of Chinese in Africa, and many Africans study in China. Countries such as Ethiopia, Senegal and South Africa seem to be doing a good job at testing random samples for coronavirus in key cities. But Liberia? Guinea? Sierra Leone? Seldom has there been a stronger argument for American global engagement to strengthen African health systems, which constitute part of own immune system against pandemics. Seldom has there been a better 

NIH-001716 argument to abandon "America First" posturing and to recognize that our own fate is closely tied to the fate of other nations. Much about the future course of the disease depends on the answer to a scientific question: Is someone who has the virus but lacks symptoms - or has symptoms so mild they hardly notice - capable of transmitting the virus to others? "It looks like the answer is yes," says Fauci. Which would make the virus far harder to control. "We may find that the virus is highly transmissible, but less lethal than we thought in the beginning," Fauci told me . In this case, the danger would be similar to a particularly bad influenza. And the outbreaks could be seasonal, like the flu as well. "I would not be surprised if that happened," Fauci concluded.

I write because I saw your interview on PBS tonight and had a question pertaining to denominators and numerators. Please know that I profess absolutely no expertise in areas pertaining to biology nor medicine nor disease and while I understood and agree with your estimation that the fatality rate of the Corona virus to date may be somewhat inflated of the number of cases is understated, I have a related NIH-001717 

NIH-001718 question for you regarding info I was able to find at this site https://www .worldometers.info/coronav irus/ Regarding data this site reports, among many things, and as one scrolls down, that the 'number of active cases' reported today is 57,228 and the number of these that are 'serious or critical' is 12,064. In a worst case scenario, and taking the 12,064 as the numerator and dividing it by a denominator of 57,228, we get 21 .08, or about 21 %, much higher that the 1 % based on total deaths over total cases so far. Of course this is not fair but my question is this: can we know better how many of the patients (cases) who are 'serious or critical' and still being treated will recover? Thanks much for any reply￾Alan DiCara, Winsted, CT

The meeting is set to take place on Thursday, February 20, 2020 from 9:30am to 1:30pm at the World Bank Offices in Washington DC (located at 1818 H St NW) on floor C2, conference room MC C2-125. As you know, the novel Coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China, is evolving rapidly. As of today, the number of confirmed cases has increased significantly to over 60,000 and the virus has reached 25 countries. The outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), poses a threat to countries worldwide, especially those with weak health systems and low levels of pandemic preparedness. It is of urgent importance that we move quickly to finance the development of the appropriate countermeasures for a disease that risks becoming endemic across the globe. Two critical issues are necessary to address: i) immediate financing for the development and scale-up of a diversified portfolio of vaccines, and ii) financing the manufacturing and procurement of vaccine for global distribution. To enhance our discussions we are working on a background paper which we will share along with an agenda at the earliest. Recognizing the short notice, we will provide remote connection details for those unable to travel for the meeting. A working lunch will also be provided. We hope that you will be able to participate in this important meeting.

NIH-001749 didn't have a clue but got a little cough still you can you might want to debate left me and i'm a little to keep but maybe also because of the jet lag in the travels and everything else on top of it no it doesn't feel any different than you know recuperating from a regular coal earl's wave jerry hasn't been diagnosed with the virus is she's being monitored in a different part of the hospital but their case is a good example of some things we know and some things we don't know about how this virus is spreading so we have called doctor anthony fauci he's director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases good morning sir good morning so earl coleman was fine all those days on the ship then he gets on a plane and he gets a fever what does that tell us about how this virus is spreading well the virus has the ability to bind it to certain cells in your body particularly in your long so you can get anything from miles a symptomatic illness to a cough and a fever to some people about oh about twenty percent of the people come to the attention of medical than physicians in health care providers can get serious pneumonias requiring intensive care it sounds like this individual is on the %hesitation mild side of the illness because as he said it doesn't feel much more than just a common cold and as a matter of fact corona viruses in general prior to this all one of the causes of the common cold okay so what does that tell us i mean bleary often looking at the cases we're looking at a rising death toll which is tragic we look much less at the people like early say you know my voice is raspy a had a fever had a cough the years a wide range of stuff symptoms with this virus did do do we know why some people seem to be doing okay and other people are getting hit really hard well whether a couple things about that for the first thing is that any any kind of viral infection or any pathogen infection there's always a wide range of responses in the sense almost like a bill shaped curve some people get no sim is at all and we do have a symptomatic corona virus infection with this particular episode and then there's the bulk of people who get some sort of symptoms and then a small percentage of people do really really very poorly now that relates to the ability of the body to handle the virus and the one thing we know when it's not unique to this virus is that the elderly those with underlying conditions like chronic heart disease lung disease diabetes obesity they tend to get more complications much more than for example and otherwise healthy individual and that's the reason why if you look at the death rate which is around two percent for this disease at this time it is disproportionately high are among the elderly and particularly those who have underlying conditions this is interesting question carlin is wave terry presumably they work together the entire time they were quarantined right and if he gets the virus she does not did she just get lucky do some people have some sort of immune undefended don't it's a combination that's a good question it's a combination of both there is no virus that has one hundred percent attack rate even the most of infectious of all viruses like measles doesn't get a hundred percent of of %hesitation vulnerable people but respiratory viruses particularly things like influenza or the corona virus the attack rate is burying percentage and it was if he was really likely that his wife i don't think she necessarily had any on the line immune protection though that's possible the maybe some cross reaction of immune protection with other %hesitation microbes that she came into contact with but in most likely is as you suggest the luck of the draw okay interesting 

and they got to patching wondered if you could clear something up because we've been hearing reports about so called super spread ours these you who spread the virus to a very high a number of other people and it sounds like a scary thing but and i just under is this a real phenomenon there that there are people who give the virus to more people than most and why is that happening well it is certainly the phenomenon of the super spreading israel we story with sars back in two thousand two and two thousand in three and they're episodes already with this particular new corona virus and it's a combination of two things it's an individual whose either at a particular moment in time shedding a very large amount of virus which makes it much easier to infect a group of people who are around him but you also see it sometimes in the hospital setting when you have a number of health care providers taking care of someone and that person is shedding a lot of virus so the short answer to your question is there are super spread is and it's a real phenomenon okay okay what we would you say at this moment is the most important or the most pressing question about this virus that we don't have answers to yet well what we don't know for sure we know that there are people who are infected will without symptoms or very minimal symptoms they hardly notice they're infected well we don't know is the extent to which people who have no symptoms are spreading it so we do know that this can occur because we have anecdotal documented cases of people who do not have symptoms who actually have infected someone usually a family member but we don't know the extent to which this cars in the broad component of this outbreak doctor anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases sir thanks for joining us it was a pleasure to be with you Cntical Me111ion allows users to SP,arch global TV Radio.

NIH-001762 Subject: Coronavirus Good morning, Tony, I woke up thinking this: given the relative sparing of young people during the COVID-19 outbreak, could something similar to what happens with dengue be going on? Could a second coronavirus infection - albeit with a genetically different variant than the first - bring about worse disease than the first? And, since up to a third of the common cold is caused by a variant of coronavirus, could older people somehow have been primed by an earlier coronavirus infection?

Thanks so much for yom leadership and dedicat ion, Dr. Fauci! I'm actually reaching out to you on a topic other than the coronavirus, as I am writing on behalf of the co-chairs for an important NIB-American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) conference (the NIH-AACR Cancer, Autoimmunity, and Immunology Conference) that will be taking place on March 23-24, 2020 , on the NIH campus (in the Masur Auditorium in the NIH Clinical Center). The co-chairs would like to invite you to be the opening speaker on Monday, March 23rd. Dr. Sharpless will be the opening speake r on Tuesday, March 24th . Please see the attached draft agenda. NIH-001770 

Now in its third year, the Cancer, Autoimm unity, and Immunology Conference focuses on: 1) understanding the biology of immune-related adverse events which have occurred in cancer patients treated with immunotherapies and how that might inform the study of autoimmune disease , and 2) defining the potential for the study of autoimmune disease to lead to greater understanding of the treatment and management of immune-related adverse events during and following cancer therapies. The goal of this interdisciplinary conference is to bring together people who might not typically interact to promote cross-fertilization for the betterment of both research and clinical care, which is why there are four NIH !Cs very much involved in the Conference, including: NCI, NIAID, NIAMS, and NIDDK. Chairing this effort on behalf of the AACR is Julie R. Brahmer, MD, Johns Hopkins University. From the NIH, we have Elad Sharon , MD, MPH, NCI; Ravi Madan , MD, NCI; Connie Sommers, PhD, NCI; Howard Young , PhD, NCI; Katarzyna Bourc ier, PhD, NCI; Marie Mancini , PhD, NIAMS; Annette Rothermel , PhD , NIAID; and Lisa Spain , PhD , NIDDK. I know the diverse audience, including patients , researchers , clinicians, industry , regulators, and others, would be thrilled by your presence. Of couTse, we also know that you have pa1ticipated in the previous two conference on this topic, which underscores why they would love to have you participate again! Plea se let us know at your earliest convenience if you are interested and able to participate in the conference on Monday, March 23rd. ff you have additiona l questions or concerns, you can contact me at jon.retz laff@aacr.org or (b)(6) Thanks again , Dr. Fauci , and I look forward to hearing from you !

I was reading all of the news regarding concerns and questions on how the fellow patients are being infected . A few questions arose, based on the NIH data on SARS Coronavirus , that has been much more stud ied, and most likely less viru lent than the current COVID 19, wh ich supposedly has HIV traits as well as traits to increase transmission. I have wondered if COVID-19 is like Legionella, and possibly transmitted in the airborne water droplets in the air conditioning units of the Diamond Princess ship. Even with the SARS Coronavirus, it was shown to be infective on fomites for up to 28 days unless 40 degrees Celsius and 80% humidity, when it was then inactivat ed in a few hours (see the attached article). I am wonder ing if the trays of food, after being passed to passengers on the ships, were then washed in suboptimal conditions (NOT at 40 degrees Celsium for several hours at 80% humidity) I AM concerned , that based on the reinfection of those in Wuhan, China, after they returned home, on whether 14 days of quarantine is enough, based on the modeling and studies on the SARS Coronavirus, and whether 28 days of quarantine may actually be needed. With the HIV virus component of COVID 19, one must also wonder if the T cells are being infected and passing the infection along with in an infected pat ient . In the U.S., we may need to beware of blood trans fusions from anyone infected, even asymptomatically, with COVID 19. I am sure that you have teams of clinicians and scientists working on this, and I don't know if any of the original scientists working on the SARS models are still around at Chapel Hill to perform these related studies and modeling .

Best Fran NIH-0018 14 

NIH-001815 This ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19 , outbreak has a number of historic firsts. It's the largest quarantine in world history with China locking down over 60 million people. It's the first mass repatriation of Ame1ican citizens into a quarantine , climbing over 1,000. Let's start with some quick basics: what is coronavirus? How contagious? What is the morbidity rate? How does it compare to SA Rs and MERs? More/less infectious? Lethal? Just to put this in perspective every year here in the US we deal with the flu. How many Americans on average die each year from the flu? But as I mentioned corona virus has resulted in a number of historic firsts, talk about what you expect could be our scientific firsts and what roadblocks do those scientific firsts confront? Over the years, global economic interdependence has grown in nearly every industrial sector, including health care. But that means our health care is also globally interdependent on other systems less equipped, less transparent and perhaps less responsible global actors. China closed the wet market where the coronavirus outbreak began on 1/l , gene sequenced the virus on l/9 so they could develop a diagnostic test but did not share the gene sequence with the global hea lth community until 1/12. How transparent and quick was the Chinese response? What should the have done that they failed to do? What were the consequences? China now claims more than 70K infected and almost 1800 deaths from the virus. But Jt has been widely reported that the Chinese have underreported both numbers. what are Countries international obligations to report accurately? To whom? How do you know the numbers are accurate? How does the cwTent outbreak impact the domestic medical supply chain? What steps could or should we consider to enhance supply chain resilience? What do the numbers suggest to you about what to expect regionally and worldwide? Have numbers peaked? Will they continue to 1ise? With the cruise ship there re now a total of 15 Americans infected. Do you expect additional cases? What scale? How prepared are we nationally? Locally? Looking back over the roughly past decade , emerging infectious diseases played a recurring ominous theme. Be it from HlNl, to ebola, then Zika, and now the 2019 novel coronavirus, the threat is clearly not dissipating. When it comes to non-disease natural disasters , the Stafford Act provides a Disaster Relief Fund to enable immediate response. By comparison , there is a small Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. Do we need a more Stafford Act-like mechanism to enable quicker response and research to these new threats? What other actions can we take to better prepare? While often we see folks painting emerging infectious diseases and biodefense into separate categories , the truth is that there is significant crossove r in terms of preparedness and research. Understanding that this is a sensitive topic, could you talk about how we should approach these risks in a comprehensive manner that can achieve public health and national security objectives concurrent ly? I'd like to use this to transition to the topic of bio weapons which is what we originally planned to talk about. The landscape here has also transfom1ed. When BioShield was written and the Strategic National Stockpile established we worried about State actors deploy ing banned weapons like small pox; plague and hemorrhag ic fever. And you 

NIH-001816 still must prepare against those things as well as new and emerging threats like the toxins we have seen deployed by Russia and North Korea in more targeted assassinations. How do you stay ahead of these threats? Do we have the resources and surveillance that we need to stay ahead of the threat? And ensure the necessary vaccines and therapeutics? The ebola outbreak may be an instructive example , it seems to be coming under some control despite the precarious security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But the ongoing 2018 outbreak was the second largest in history following the 2013-2016 West African outbreak. As a result of these outbreaks, the United States government has pioneered new FDA-approved diagnostics and vaccines, with promising therapeutics seemingly around the approval comer too. What lessons can we draw from the ebola outbreaks? How do you work with and incentivize industry to develop what you need in the event of a catastrophic bio attack? And How do you make the best possible decisions about the stockpile? I always worried that because we are global leaders if there was a bio attack or outbreak anywhere in the world, others would look to us and to our stockpile for the answer. Are our global allies doing enough to prepare against these tbreats--whether they be manmade or natural? Are they maintaining adequate stockpi les of medical countermeasures and research bases--and should they be? Lastly (if we have time) .... the FBI recently arrested a Harvard scientist for accepting undisclosed grant money from China for scientific research.

The written correspondence reveals that the numbers bein g release d of confirmed deaths is drastically low due to the spread be ing too fast to test. Deaths in hospital hallway s and of medical staff is not being shared in order to preve nt panic. Protec tive gear is unavai lab le and the nurse w1iting the correspon dence is fearfu l for her life . She states that there are five levels of screenings (tests?) before a person is reported as testing positive or o f being infected with the virus . If someone dies before being confirmed , these suspected deaths are covered up and not reported. Reported numbers, even of conftnned cases are gross ly undercounted . l figure you and our government realize the infonnation and numbers coming out of China are highly inaccurate, but this correspon dence on (b) (6) confirms it.

NIH-001826 So I'm hoping that your department has contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and see if you could make the following idea national or international. It is a supplemental health system based on Al and mobile technology and consists oftwo planks: First: - train an Al to be able to detect COVID-19 by measurements that can be done by cell phone (for example pictures of patients, recordings of patient's respiratory system) Second: - develop and release a smart-phone application that does the following : - turns on location tracking so health authorities can see where the cell phone owner is. - allows for people to upload health measurements from their cell phone. - keeps TRACK of where the cell phone owner is. If that person then tests positive for COVID later on, it can then automatically figure out all the contacts of that person for the last 14 days. - notifies those contacts that they have been in contact with someone with COVID-19, to isolate themselves and regularly test themselves. The goal would be to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from descending on hospitals and overwhelming them, and to allow for the CDC or other medical personnel to go OUT and get them - or isolate them for treatment in their own homes - rather than having them come in and infect everybody. Now th is all hinges on the idea that Al could detect COVID-19 based on an audio recording or a simple picture and do it reliably, but I'm fairly sure that it can based of the peer-reviewed literature. It is not a difficult Al problem assuming that the microphone can pick up sounds well enough - if not, there are already integrated stethoscopes for cell phones that could be mass produced - and once developed to enough precision it could be deployed nationally or internationally fairly easily. For all I know something like this is already in the works but I haven't heard of anything like it - apart from the chinese app which AFAICT does not use any Al but DOES allow for automatic contact tracing. I sincerely hope this is already in the works. Ultimately it could be used both for detection and treatment - assuming the current antivirals work out they could be distributed to the same coordinates that positive diagnoses come in, perhaps by cheap drone so that nobody actually needs to be exposed to the virus to effect treatment . Anyways, thanks for your time and efforts. Personally I'm a software developer but I'm hoping that perspective his helpful - for I view the fight against this virus as an INFORMATIONAL fight. It's like a fire-suppression system or food safety measures. Again, I have no clue whether or not this is already being done, and I apologize in advance if I'm missing something and this all seems obvious . I just think that in this case it is prudent for us to be safe rather than sorry. Thanks much,

We are particularly interested in getting your evaluation of the passengers who have been released from two cruise ships. The first, in Yokohama, Japan, where over 300 Americans released from the ship have now arrived back in the US, to go into 14 days of quarantine. 14 of those people tested positive at some point after leaving the ship, but before they boarded the plane. The second ship we want to focus on is in Cambodia. Something in the neighborhood of 1,000 passengers released from that ship have been reported to be in some state of travel to their homes, presumably around the globe. One woman who made it as far as Malaysia tested positive there and is hospitalized in Kuala Lumpur. We do know that the CDC is working with WHO and the cruise ship line to track down those traveling people . We would very much like to hear from you what level of concern we should have over those many hundreds of people traveling right now, how well quarantine works, how important it is to maintain it, etc. We would also like to touch on the methods of containment and treatment being done inside China and how well those methods have worked. I realize it is a holiday, and that could complicate things. But please let me know whether you could consider this, Doctor, and we wi ll begin to work out the logistics. Thank you.

Would you be able to elaborate on the measures taken to keep the 14 US evacuees who have coronavi rus from infecting others on board the plane? I know that remdesivir, under compassionate use, was given to at least the first Amer ican coronavirus patient, and last week NIH researchers published results early that it had preventive effect s for macaques exposed to MERS. Has the US considered using this drug to protect those exposed to but not yet infected with coronavirus? Thank you, Natalie A Rahhal Acting US Health Editor Dailylltail.com - NIH-001845

From: Sent: To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E) Sun, 16 Feb 2020 22:28:19 +0000 Jon LaPook Subject : RE: Coronavirus Jon: I have no idea what this guy is talking about. 1 have never said the RO was close to 5 or 6. The RO is about 2.0 to 2.2. Also, the situation is as we have discussed on several occasions . In the USA, the travel restrictions seem to be working with only 15 cases in the USA (13 travel and 2 spouses) . But, as I have said, this could change. Ifwe get substantial sustained transmission in a numbe r of countries throughout the world, including the developing world, then sooner or later there will be significant leakage of infect ed individuals into the US A since you cannot restr ict incoming travel from the whole woild. T he way we might be able to avoid a real globa l pandemic is if the non -Chfoa countr ies can co nta in the infect ions in their respec tive count ries before there is widely distrib uted sustained transmissions. Once w idely distributed sustained transmissions happen, a globa l pandemic is inevitable. What would a global pand emic mean? ft depends on the true rate s of morbidity and mortality. The curre ntly repo rted mortality of COVI D-19 is about 21/o. However, there are seve ra l folds more cases than are coming to the official attention of health autho1ities, i.e. asymptomatic or minima lly symptomatic in fections . If yo u cou nt these, the denominator gets much larger and the case fatality rate could drop to 1% of even 0.5 % or less. If that is the case, then this could be a very severe seasona l flu (0.2% to 0.4% ; regular seaso nal flu is 0.1 %) or a typical pandemic like 1957 or 1968 (0.5% -0.9 %). We are not sure where it is goi ng to land . Hope this is helpful . Best, Tony Anthony S.

John Spike mutation pipeline reveals the emergence of a more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2 Korber 81, Fischer WM 1, Gnanakaran S1, Yoon Ht, Theiler Ji, Abfalterer Wt , Foley 81, Giorgi EEi, Bhattacharya T1, Parker M0 3, Partridg e DG4, Evans CM 4, de Silva Tl4,s, on beh alf of the Sheffi eld COVID-19 Genomics Group#, LaBranche CC2, and Mont efiori DC2 Summary (b) (5) We have developed an analysis pipelin e to facilitate real-time mutation tracking in SARS-CoV-2, focusing initia lly on the Spike (S) protein because it mediates infect ion of human cells and is the target of most vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics. To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically , and over time, to provide an early warn ing system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmissio n or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling . The mutation Spike 0614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form . Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple stra in infections . These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions .

The 24t h Annual Webby Awards would like to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his creation of ncov2019.live to track the spread of COVID-19 across the world. As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19, including the difficult, but critica l calls for nationwide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood of people looking for accurate information about the novel coronavirus and the necessary steps to combat it. Since launching the site on December 29th, Schiffmann's tracking tool has been an invaluable resource that sounded the alarm on the virus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before many global officials . At a time when the spread of misinformation can be so detrimental to our efforts, the site has provided over 600 million visitors wit h accurate real-t ime data. Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and the importance of measures to flatten the curve . For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating an essential website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere , it is my great privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year.

Only 50 industry leaders are being asked to contribute. Commitments have been secured from an impressive group, including a retired four-star general and a preeminent constitutiona l scholar. I very much hope you will take part in this inno vative projec t given your historic and unparalleled contributions to the public's understanding of the current crisis. With respect to logistics , I am hoping to receive commitments from all authors this month , with essays due within one month, and with the 

essays availab le through Amazon's expedited publishing platform rough ly one month after that. Each essay should be no more than 1,000 words, and I may offer light edits for the author's final approva l. A final note: all proceeds from the sa le of the book will be donated.

A truly deadly virus cannot spread very far . Why? Because people quickly get sick and die. In other words, they cannot spread the virus further , which is a prerequisite for a large spread like corona. Covid-19 has spread throughout the world. The premise is that it is not very dangerous, it causes mild symptoms for most people, many do not even notice that they were sick. But the virus has different phases in the body, after a while it goes into a resting phase, you feel better, but the virus is still present and can pass on. Covid-19 is an optimally developed virus that spreads rapidly around the world. But if it were really deadly, almost everyone would die. 

So far in our 4 billion long history, there have been no airborne viruses or bacteria. Yes, in the hollywood movie "outbreak" there was, but it was a movie. Why hasn't it? If it had existed, this planet would have been a dead planet without life. It would have killed all living. It is possible that there is somewhere else in the universe, but not here on planet Earth. Not now. Remember, this is not the first time a new virus is spreading in the world. What is happening now has happened earlier in our long history . But people are die you say. Yes, but the virus don't kill them . The virus open a "door" in the cell wall thats allows for bacterias, how always are present, to invade the body and create an aggressiv bacterial superinfection. That's what kills them . See, 1. Influenza and Bacterial Superinfection: Illuminating the Immunologic Mechanisms of Disease.

May she rest in peace in heaven. --- It seems that the corona virus has affected the brain more in a certain group in society, name ly politicians, doctors, journalists and other with power and positions in the society. The virus is not dangerous for this group, but it's opens a door in the brain's cell wall that allows it to enter the fear center of the brain. This door has been closed for many years. We haven't had any major wars and nothing has threatened them. They have felt invulnerable. Convinced of their own superior abil ity and grea tness. Not only can they control the people, they can now control the climate by turning the carbon dioxide tap. If they close it, the temperature drops, if they open it the temperature goes up. They don't know tha t the sun is 109 time s as big as our planet. 109 times . It seams so small when we look up in the sky. They thought they could cont rol everything. Then came the VIRUS, they receive an abrupt awakening. They get scared. Politicans get sick and die. Doctors die. The brain is attacked by fear virus. They can no longer think clearly and logically. The pan ic is near, they are reminded of their own morta lity. Just like a virus in a computer. It's slows it down and it becomes unusable. Tha ts whats happen when a fear virus attacks the brain. Here where I live, there are panic over 1600 confirmed cases. The telev ison is talking "infected persons" when t here is "confirmed laboratory cases". It's two different things. Misleading the people . Why panic over 1 600 infected? Closing all not nessecary bui ssness, all school s, all excep t for supe rmarket, gas station, banks. You can't go out after 5.00 pm. If you do, you get arrested. 

Why? They are scared. Because the ruling class is afraid. Everyone with this masks. Doctors crying on television. The President with mask. They are scared . Doctors. Journalists. Polices. 2020. The year when the world got completely crazy. You have an medical obligation to inform the world about the truth. Kind regards, Ola Melhus

Four work ing grou ps were formed out of this meeti ng to focus on precli nical therapeutics, clinical therapeutics, clinical trial capacity, and vaccines. Although some ICs have representatives participating in t he working groups, we recognize there is a need to keep everyone looped in to the various activities and prog ress of the partnership, particula rly in view of all of the concurrent IC projects about COVID-19. The ACTIV working groups will be delivering their second report to the ACTIV Leadership Group on W ednesday, M ay 6, from 3:30-5:00 pm. I am writing to invite the ICDs to listen-in on this meeting. There will be a lot to cover during the meeting and the members of the Leadership Group will be asking the questions . But to give a chance for us NI Hers to 

discuss what has been presented, I am scheduling a separate ICD call for 5:05-5:30pm, immediately follow ing the ACTIV leadership meeting. If you are available to take part, please send your responses to David Wholley and Cheryl Melencio of FNIH (cc'd here) by noon tomorrow , May 5th.

This year, due to the impact of the coronavirus The Webby Awards are mov ing their renowned award show to an online experience. On May 19th, 2020, the 24th Annual Webby Awar ds wi ll bring together Webby Winners from around the world in an Internet Celebration whic h wi ll showcase t he artists, organi zations, and creators using th eir platforms to imagine a bette r tomorrow th rough informa t ion, educatio n, movement, comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact posit ive change. The 24th Annual Webby Awa rds are proud to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his creation of ncov2019.liv e to track the spread of COVID-19 across the world. We would be honored if Dr. Fauci would "virtually" present Avi with his award . As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19 on the world and late calls for nation-wide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood for people looking for accurate information about the novel coronavirus. Since launching the site on December 29th , Avi Schiffmann's tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before many global officials. By providing over 100 million visitors with real-time data on the virus' spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and measures to flatten the curve. For having the fore sight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating a website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere, it is our great privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year. The celebration will highlight the important work Avi and his fellow winners are doing, and will mark his hallmark Webby 5-Word acceptance speech in Internet history. Dr. Fauci's presenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can send you through a script for him to review, edit and details for format and deadline. This year's Webby Awards will also take action, t he impact of COVID-19 and govern ment responses around the world, has brought the importance of vot ing into sharp focus. The 

Webby Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter registration status of 1 million voters in the United States, promoting the importance of voting to help ensure vote r turnout this November is the highest it has ever been. This partnership will integrate into all elements of this year's on line celebration. Our thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time. Best Lesley Cahill Roy (b)(6)

I had planned to write to thank you for giving an inte rview (b)(6) for the Washington Post last month. Your generosity with time was 'all Tony,' and I did appreciate it . was waiting for the chaos around you to subside before writing but ..... 2. Last evening I was asked to forward the message below to you. You might already know Jack Warren, Professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at U. Maryland (b)(6) As his email says, (b)(6) Samsung's venture capital group, whic h has an idea for a future, comprehensive surveillance system for COVID-19 (b)(4) . It is interesting, but all I know is what I read in the power-point attached. I cannot imagine you would have time to look at it yourself, but perhaps it could be shared with other systems-oriented individuals working towards 'opening up' responsibly. 

Pardon me for stepping out of my normal NTD 'swim lane' but I did want to help out (b) ~ _ , and certainly nothing is more important these days than COVID-19 and the outstanding work you are doing to manage it. All the very best, -Eric l=rom: Warren , John [ma ilta (b)(6)] Sent : Thursday, April 30, 2020 ----------- 6:52 PM To: (b) (6) Subject: Jack Warren Eric A voice from the past. Covid-19 prevented us from meeting up (b)(6l b I' .. ut m writing because it might yet bring at least the two of us together. ------- (b)(6) Samsung's venture capital group and his team has what I think is an incredibly useful idea ----- for contact tracing for covid-19 as well as actually open ing the economy up again. The idea is contained within the attachment. I wonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so, could you see your way clear to forwarding the attachment to him? The group has identified some appropriate test manufacturers but is at the point where they need to know the spectrum so as to focus on the optima l ones. The thought was that Tony Fauci might be the best person to know what tests are in development stage. What are your thoughts? Don't worry about confidentiality; they want to widely share this idea so as to get it out as quickly as possible. Thanks Jack Warren MD Professor of Medicine Division of Infect ious Diseases University of Maryland School of Medicine Baltimore MO 21201 (b)(6)

We were hopeful we could steal just an hour of your time in June for an important discussion on COVID-19 and exercise training. This is part of a virtual agenda for one of our national conferences (Care of the Athletic Heart) with outreach around the world given this is a part of the ACC educational platform. We hope th is is something you have the bandwidth for, and simply appreciate your consideration. I hope to hear from you and thank you for all your service once again.

To: (b)(6) ----======;----- Cc: Ryan Meyer Cb)( ·>; Robyn Snyder _____ Cb_>_<_,> Subject: INVITE- American College of Cardiology Dr. Fauci￾On behalf of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), first I would like to thank you for your tremendous service throughout your incredible career and certainly during these present and challenging times. We are indebted to your service and thankful everyday we have you to help guide public health measures through the COVID-19 pandemic . I am a member of the Sports and Exercise Council for the ACC and the Course Chair for our annual ACC Care of the Athletic Heart Conference. Originally scheduled June 18-20, 2020 at ACC Heart House in Washington DC. I am also faculty at Emory University and direct our sports cardiology program in Atlanta. Of course, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our live meeting in June, but myself along with the staff at ACC are working very hard transitioning the course to a virtual course and agenda. This course will be a much shorter version and the agenda will all be pre-recorded and distributed as a 'live simulated version' on June 20, 2020. With the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of life and society, in our academic world of sports cardiology, we are dealing with how COVID has impacted exercise and athletes. As you can imagine, there are a multitude of different issues and questions that colleagues are raising. One new session for our virtual agenda that we think will generate a lot of interest and is of high importance will be a panel discussion on sports, exercise, and COVID-19. We would like to get additional expertise on the panel from the ID/pub lic health and Sports Medic ine arenas, in addition to sports cardiology. Of course, there is no one that carries the expertise you do from the ID and publ ic health perspective and we would be extremely honored if you could be a part of this one session and join our faculty for the course. Before getting into more details and a formal invite from the ACC, I wanted to first see if you had the bandwidth for this. Understanding you are as busy, if not busier, than anyone in the world right now. This session would be pre-recorded and we would certainly work to be flexible with anytime you had for this in early June to record. I hope this is something that could work- again we would be honored to host you virtually. Many thanks for considering, and hope to hear from you soon. Best, Jonathan Kim Jonathan H.

Subject: Coronavir us: Covid 19 Hi Dr Fauci, Please find an audio attached of a doctor describing the experience with regards to covid 19 in the hospital. She seems to suggest covid 19 is a virus tha t rather attacks the blood cell, leading to respiratory and other organ comp lications, hence they need to loom at tre atme nt in a differ ent light. In the UK some hospitals have moved away from using ventilators due to the high death rate of those on ventilators, and are rat her using ventilators for sleep apnea, as they are less invasive, and the results are much much better compared to invasive ventilators There are some anecdotal observations I have also made. The infection rate in most African countries seem to be comparatively low, w hich could possibly due to the rate of testing being conducted. However t he death rates are also comparative ly very low. From initial informat ion with regards to 

hydroxychloroquine and some antimalaria drugs usage, it was suggested that those who were alleged to have had some benefits had mild symptoms of covid 19. I know some clinical trials have shown hydroxychloroquine not to be effect ive in the treatment of covid 19 in very ill patients. However, my hypothesis is, are the low death rates in Africa linked to the fact that malaria is very prevelant in Africa, and lots of Africans take antimalarial drugs, making them less susceptible to covid 19, hence the low death rate. Is there a similar trend in other countries where malaria is prevalent? Is there an unintended benefit of taking antimalarial drug (or other medication) before covid infection, or at the onset, making people less susceptible to covid19 . As I said, this is based on anecdota l observations. Yours sincerely Ato Stephens

Knowing how busy you are, l am sending this email in lieu of a call to prepare for the session. As you know , this is a 90 minute session which aims to provide our audience with deeper insights into the latest developments in the COVID-19 response. I plan to hold an engaging discussion that covers the whole experience on dealing with this pandemic - from US to international, to preparedness and response, the biology of the vims, the state of diagnostic , treatment and vaccine development, and the importance of commun ication. I will begin the session by providing brief ( ~3 min) opening remarks describing the circumstances of the pandemic . Then, I will introduce the panelists and you will each have 7 minutes to provide remarks. You 

may use a limited number of slides for illustration. I hope that each panelist will provide their own perspective and speak to the issues proposed below. • Jeremy Farrar will discuss the global response to the pandemic, drawing from his experience as a globa l leader, the chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for the WHO's R&D Blueprint and as a member of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board. • Tony Fauci will discuss the US pandemic and provide his perspective as a member of the White House Corona virus Task Force addressing the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic. • George Gao will discuss China's response to the pandem ic and lessons learned for the rest of the globe . • Susan Weiss will discuss the viral characteristics of SARS COV2 , insights into its pathobiology, immunity and development of a pan-Co V antiviral. • Richard Hatchett will discuss the development of new vaccines and treatments against COV ID-19 . • San jay Gupta will comment on the health system response to the pandemic and challenges related to communication and public engagement in responding to COVID-19. Following remarks from each panelist, we will have a moderated discussion amongst ourselves - I will ask you a set of questions ( 15 mins) and then we will take questions from the web (25 mins). To prepare me to be your moderator, please send me any questions you would like me to ask you. For those of you who would like to have a prep call, please let me know and I will set it up.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Ant hony Fauci attends a coronavirus response meet ing between U.S. President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington , U.S., April 29, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria The dramatic announcement by Dr Anthony Fauci in the Oval Office on Wednesday prompted concerns among scientists that the Trump administration was raising hopes about a coronav irus treatment before sharing the full data with researchers. As a cautionary example of inflating the potential value of a therapy, some pointed to President Donald Trump's repeated endorsements of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment , with no evidence that it works . Newer data suggests the malaria treatments may carry significant risks for some sufferers of the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is running the trial, said he took the first opportunity to get the word out that patients taking a dummy treatment or placebo should be switched to remdesivir in hopes of benefiting from it . He expressed concern that leaks of partial information would lead to confusion . Since the White House was not planning a daily virus briefing, Fauci said he was invited to release the news at a news conference with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards(D). "It was purely driven by ethical concerns," Fauci told Reuters in a telephone interview. "I would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting, but it's just not in the cards when you have a situation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the conver sation ." An independent data safety and monitoring board, which had looked at the preliminary results of the NIAID trial, determined it had met its primary goal of reducing hospital stays. 

On Tuesday evening, that information was conveyed in a conference call to scientists studying the drug globally. "There are literally dozens and dozens of investigators around the wo rld/' Fauci said. "People were starting to leak it." But he did not give details of where the unreported data was being shared. Several scientists interviewed by Reuters felt the White House sett ing seemed inappropriate for the release of highly anticipated government-funded trial data on the Gilead therapy . They had expected it to be presented simultaneously in a detailed news release, a briefing at a medical meet ing or in a scientific journal, allowing researchers to review the data. Informat ion from various trials of remdesivir has been leaked to media in recent weeks . In a statement on Wednesday, Gilead said the NIAi D's much anticipated trial had met its primary goal, but gave no details . Data in a separate NIAID statement after Fauci spoke detailed preliminary results showing that patients who got the drug had a 31 percent faster time to recovery than those who got a placebo, cutting hospital stays by four days. The trial also came close to showing the drug helped people survive the disease, but the data fell just short of statistical significance. "I want to see the full data. I want to understand the statistics. I want to understand the benefit and risk. I want to understand the structure of the study, and all of it," said Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief academic officer at the Cleveland Clinic. "Am I encouraged from what I've heard? Yes, I'm encouraged . But I want to get a full understanding of what happened here, and not get it via a photo opportunity from the Oval Office ." Data Gilead released on its own trial of remdesivir drew less attention, as it did not compare outcomes between those receiving therapy and those who did not . Results from a third study in China suggesting remdesivir failed to help COVID-19 patients were released in the British medical journal the Lancet after review by a peer group of scientists . "That's the only thing I'll hang my hat on, and that was negative," said Dr. Eric Topol, directo r and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. He was unimpressed by remdesivir's modest benefit . "It was expected to be a whopping effect," Topol added . "It clearly does not have that ." At the Oval Office news conference, Fauci compared the study findings to AZT, the first drug to show any benefit against HIV, decades ago. "We know that was an imperfect drug. It was the first step," Fauci said in the interview. "Similar to AZT, it's (remdesivir) the first baby step towards what hopefully will be a number of better drugs that will come in and be able to treat people with COVID-19. 11 (This story has been refiled to correct spelling of "clinical 11 in paragraph one) Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by M ichele Gershberg and Clarence Fernandez Our Standards :The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

But it has also been demonstrated that NAD levels can be replenished through oral administration of nicotin amide ribo side (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NR in particular has had several human studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, and roughly 50 human studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov fo r all manner of disorders. There is at least one anecdotal repo rt of dramatic improvement in a Covid-19 patient after

I have always been grateful for yo ur public service, but feel part icular ly indebted to you these days. 

To add to the debt ... Josh and I wanted to see if you would be willing to join a call with Business Roundtable CEOs. We have been doing COVID-19 calls with them every Friday at 1:30pm . Typically, about 100-125 CEOS of large, U.S.-based firms will join. They are all managing and planning for difficult issues around employee and customer safety . They would love to hear from you directly and to ask a few questions . It might also be a good place to deliver any messages you want them to hear. We completely understand if it isn't doable, of course. If you are able, we would love to host you sometime between 1:30pm -2:30pm this Friday (or any Friday on which your schedule wou ld allow it). Best, Kristen

We understand that the trial has met its primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming briefing. In addition to the NIAID trial, Gilead expects to share additiona l remdesivir data from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID￾19 disease shortly. This study will provide information on whether a shorter, 5-day duration of therapy may have similar efficacy and safety as the 10-day treatment course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing tria ls. Gilead expects data at the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease. 

Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID-19.

So you will see attached a presentation about the program and if you or your country is interested please let me know and I will put you in contact with the company making this program. I did not send this email to you so we make money on people it's to help I just wanted to help. I will be contacting my contacts in the USA from Thursday morning but first 1 wanted to talk with you and give you the opportunity to see if Mr Trump would interested in this program for your country. Tf nothing comes back from you anyway my friend and contact in the USA will talk with the white house but l wanted to do it the proper way by talking to you as you are the main medical person in the USA for the coronavirus .

COVID-19 is typically signaled by three symptoms: a fever, an insistent cough and shortnes s of breath. But older adults - the age group most at risk of severe complications or death from t his cond ition - may have none of these characteristics. Instead, seniors may seem "off" - not acting like themselves - early on afte r being infected by the coronavirus . They may sleep more than usual or stop eating. They may seem unusually apathetic or confused, losing orientation to their surroundings. They may become dizzy and fall. Sometimes, seniors stop speaking or simply collapse. (b)(6)

I am reaching out on behalf of one of my partners, Robert Karofsky, Co-President of UBS Investment Bank, with an invitation to join the UBS Global response to Covid-19 in a live streaming moderated discussion on May 18. Alternatively your conversation could be pre-recorded to accommodate your busy schedule. At this critically important time in our nation's history, the investment community wants to help our nation fight Covid-19 and use our country's economic engine to find a cure and solutions for Covid-19. They also are thinking through how to help our nation's businesses going forward. Your expertise is important to this conversation . By way of background, I served in the White House for eight years in the Bush Administration as the Social Secretary to Vice President Cheney.

I have often listened to your inspiring words on the news and followed your assiduous work to help us through this pandemic. Our school participates in Model UN, an event in which high school students represent various countries in debates on international issues from the past and present. Colorado's final Model UN conference was canceled , so our school (bH6) ) decided to host an online conference for the whole state of ----------- Colorado and beyond . Our team would like to formally invite you to give a short address (be it pre-recorded or live online) to the student s during our opening ceremony . We hope that our conference will inspire the youth of our nation and the world to stand up and fight for our future rather than resign their aspirations to lockdown . We host this conference because we see the importance of keeping our academ ic passions going while staying safe within the confines of our homes . We host this conference because we want to contribut e to the fight against COVID-19 - money raised from our conference will go towards buying masks, food, and other resources for those who need it most. This is why we ask you , a hero during this troubling time, to speak to the students of our conference, who not only include the youth of Colora do , but also the youth of our country and world. Any type of address would be greatly and wholeheartedly appreciated. If your address is pre-recorded , we would appreciate it if we could receive it by May 1st, as our conference is the morning of May 2nd . We believe you can bring true inspiration into our hearts and minds . We know you are very busy, but if it were at all possib le to share with us even a short 2-3 minute pre-recor ded greeting and message to the students participating in this Model UN conference , it would be truly inspirational. Thank you so much for your time , we hope to hear from you soon . Most Respectfully, Dane Cohn and the entire (b)( 6) Model UN Team ---------

I'm reaching out because Chair Delauro would like to invite Dr. Fauci to a hearing next Wednesday, May 6, with the House LHHS appropriations subcommittee . The focus of the hearing, not surprisingly, would be COVID-19. Members of the subcommittee wo uld very much like to hear from Dr. Fauci on anything related to COVID-19, but I think the main topics would be: • Mitigation and Testing; and • Progress on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, as well as necessary preparations to manufacture and disseminate a vaccine once it is ready. 

Chair Delaura is flexible about a starting time for the hearing on Wednesday , so she would be happy to accommodate a t ime that works for Dr. Fauci's schedule. Please let me know as soon as possible, so we can plan accordingly. Thanks so much, Stephen Stephen Steigleder House Appropriations Committee Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee

At the same time, NIH will seek opportunit ies to move more advanced diagnost ic technolog ies swiftly through the development pipeline towa rd commercialization and broad availabil ity. As part of the initiative, NIH is urging scientists and inventors with a rapid test ing technology to compete in a nat ional COVID-19 testing challenge for a share of up to $500 million over all phases for further developmen t. The goal is to add tens of millions per month of accurate and easy-to-use tests to all Americ ans by Fall 2020. Impact on COVID-19 Pandemic Response: RADx will accelerate the development, validation, and commercializ ati on of innovative new testing methods that can be deployed in point-of-care and home settings. These technologies are urgently needed to guide and inform safe return to work, schoo l, and life activities.

In addition , the study will examine whether rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection differ between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions and children who do not. Your draft quote is as follows : 110ne interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children have become sick with COVID-19 compared to adults," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.O. "Is this because children are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2, or because they are 

infected but do not develop symptoms? The HE ROS study will help us begin to answer these and other key questions."

CNN Elizabeth.Cohen@turner.com Topic: Statement by ASF during Saturday NAS web briefing Deadline: urgent Hi Patty, Elizabeth would like to clarify something that Dr. Fauci apparently said about remdesiv ir during his NAS web briefing on Saturday. The transcribed segment of the talk that she is focused on says: "Remdesivir is the one that's gotten the most publicity. It is interesting that if you look at it in a prophylactic therapeutic model in MERS coronavirus infection, it looked pretty good. There was clinical benefits just reported a couple of weeks ago of SARS coronavirus 2 in rhesus macaques." She wants to clarify what Dr. Fauci meant by looking at remdesivir "in a prophylactic therapeutic model in MERS"-whether this means in an animal model or something else. It sounds like that phrase is referring to the RML study in which remdesivir successfully prevented disease in MERS-infected rhesus macaques, as reported in the Feb. 13 NIAID media availability pasted below . Is that correct? Best, Laura Remdesivir Prevents MERS Coronavirus Disease in Monkeys Results Support Testing Antiviral Against 2019 Novel Coronavirus February 13, 2020 The exper imental antiviral remdesivir successfully prevented disease in rhesus macaques infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to a new study from National Institutes of Health scientists. Remdesivir prevented disease when administered before infection and improved the condition of macaques when given after the animals already were infected. The new report from NI H's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. MERS-CoV is closely related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) that has grown to be a global public health emergency since cases were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December. Remdesivir has previously protected animals against a variety of viruses in lab experiments . The drug has been shown experimentally to effectively treat monkeys infected with Ebola and Nipah viruses. Remdesivir also has been invest igated as a treatment for Ebola virus disease in people. The current study was conducted at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana. The work involved three groups of animals: those treated with remdesivir 24 

hours before infection with MERS-CoV; those treated 12 hours after infection (close to the peak time for MERS-CoV replication in these animals); and untreated control animals. The scientists observed the animals for six days. All control animals showed signs of respiratory disease. Animals treated before infection fared well: no signs of respiratory disease, significantly lower levels of virus replication in the lungs compared to control animals, and no lung damage. Animals treated after infection fared significantly better than the control animals: disease was less severe than in control animals, their lungs had lower levels of virus than the control animals, and the damage to the lungs was less severe. The scientists indicate that the promising study results support additional clinical trials of remdesivir for MERS-CoV and COVID-19, the disease that SARS-CoV-2 causes. Several clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID-19 are under way in China, and other patients with COVID-19 have received the drug under a compassionate use protocol. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Aut hority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also provided support for this study . Gilead Sciences, Inc., developed remdesivir, also known as GS-5734, and collaborated in the research. MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Through December 2019, the World Health Organization had confirmed 2,499 MERS-CoV cases and 861 deaths (or about 1 in 3). Because about one-third of MERS-CoV cases spread from infected people being treated in healthcare settings, the scientists suggest that remdesivir could effectively prevent disease in other patients , contacts of patients , and healthcare workers . They also note the drug might help patients who are diagnosed with MERS or COVID-19 if given soon after symptoms start. ARTICLE: Ede Wit et al.

I'm reaching out to invite you in our show. Mrs. Gruber would be honored to have you, Dr. Fauci explore in more depth the challenges Coronavirus has forced th e world to face. Can make this happen? Below is Lilli Grube r's bio and a brief description of the show. WHO : Lilli Gruber is the editor-in-chief and host of Italy's most influential political daily talk show, "Otto e mezzo", airing on prime-t ime on La7 TV. She's received Italy's most prestigio us journalism awards for her work and was the first woman to ever conduct the prime-time News broadc ast in Italy (RAI TV, 1987). As a foreign correspondent she covered most of last 30 years' major world events, from the fall of the Berlin wall to 9/11 to the Iraq war. Beside her te levision work, Ms. Gruber wrote eleven bestseller books including "Eredita", which was top seller for 20 weeks and ran 14 reprints. In 2004, Ms. Gruber 

won a head-to-head campaign against Silvio Berlusconi by a large margin of votes and was elected to the European Parliament. There, among other appointments, she was the Head of the EU Delegation to the Gulf States and Yemen and a member of the EU Delegation to Iran. "Otto e mezzo" Italy's most influential political daily ta lk show shown on prime-time on La7 TV. Through interviews with elected political figures and candidates for office, commentators, and journal ists, the show focuses on international political news and economy wi th a special focus on Italy and Europe. Beginning in 2008 "Otto e Mezzo" became Lilli Gruber's way to keep her commitment to holding those in power accountable by asking questions and touching on topics citizens are curious about. Otto e Mezzo airs Monday to Saturday from 8:35pm to 9:10pm. Within this time-frame Paolo Pagliaro's news column "II Punto" stands out for accuracy and thoughtfulness by pulling the thread on the highest rated issues in an agenda. During the current season Otto e Mezzo has become Italy's most watched political talk show reaching an average of 7.3% of share with 2.5 million viewers per day.

Then , I will introduce the panelists and you will each have 7 minutes to provide remarks. You may use a limited number of slides for illustration . I hope that each panelist will provide their own perspective and speak to the issues proposed below. • Jeremy Farrar will discuss the global response to the pandemic, drawing from his experience as a global leader, the chair of the Scientific Advisory Group for the VvHO's R&D Blueprint and as a member of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board . • Tony Fauci will discuss the US pandemic and provide his perspective as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force addressing the 2019- 20 coronavirus pandemic. • George Gao will discuss China 's response to the pandemic and lessons learned for the rest of the globe. • Susan Weiss will discuss the viral characteristics of SARS COV2, insights into its pathobiology, immunity and development ofa pan-CoV antiviral. • Richard Hatchett will discuss the development of new vaccines and treatments against COVID-19. • Sanjay Gupta wtll comment on the health system response to the pandemic and challenges related to communication and public engagement in responding to COVID-19. 

Following remarks from each panelist, we will have a moderated discussion amongst ounelves - I will ask you a set of questions ( 15 mins) and then we will take questions from the web (25 mins). To prepare me to be your moderator , please send me any questions you would like me to ask you. For those of you who would like to have a prep call, please let me know and I will set it up.

Minority communities continue to be over-looked in crises and the impact of such crises on their respective communities. For you to be int entional about keeping the minor ity communities in th e loop is commendable, especially since these communities will be absorbing the disproport ionate share of the sicknesses and deaths coming from COVID-19.

Subject: Update on Sara Alert Importance: High Dear Jerome, I hope you are well. Thank you for all you are doing to represent public health and our nation. It is very comforting knowing you are informing the nations COVID-19 response. I wanted to give you an update on called Sara Alert, the software program I am leading at MITRE. Sara Alert is being provided free of any costs and deployed in state, tribal, and local health departments to support public health in contact tracing and active monitoring of individuals in isolation and quarantine. We are engaged with ASTHO, NACCHO, CSTE, and the application is hosted live on APHL's AIMS platform. Sara Alert officially launched on April 3 and is currently supporting multiple jurisdictions including Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Danbury, CT, and the State of Arkansas. It is also being rolled out in Washington, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maine and Vermont. We are getting ready to launch in additional jurisdictions over the next couple of weeks. We have recently responded to questions we were told came from the White House so I wanted to make sure you have background materials. I imagine you are the person that the President and Vice President would turn to for information. I am happy to arrange any briefing mater ials or demo that would be helpful for you to respond. As I mentioned previously, Sara Alert is a standards-based, open source tool that automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected w ith COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and wi ll serve as an enduring national resource to contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations. Best wishes to you. Stay healthy for all of us. Paul ABOUT SARA ALERT In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the MITRE Corporat ion, a not-for-profit that works in the publ ic interest, developed Sara Alert, a standards-based, open source tool in partnership with national public health organizations. Sara Alert automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected with COVID-19 (or any disease, it's configurable) - and will serve as an enduring national resource to contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations . • Sara Alert allows public health officials to import and enroll individuals (or households) at risk of developing or infected with COVID-19. • Individuals enter their symptoms daily via web, text, email or phone, allowing public health officials to focus on high risk and non-reporting individuals . • The web-based tool enables increased efficiency in tracking cases, leading to earlier containment of the virus and reduction of burden on public health resources. • Sara Alert is a national system and allows transferal of monitorees across jurisdictions for tighte r contact tracing. Sara Alert launched on April 3 and is now supporting multiple jurisdictions . Sara Alert YouTube Video : https://youtu.be/lQxAuNsg-RA

I'm a bit at a loss to know how to respond to Bob Gallo. Francis From: Gallo, Robert (b)( > Sent: Sunday , May 3, ---------- 2020 12:07 PM ------~~ To: Collins, Francis (NIH/OD) (E]..._ ______ Cb_) _(6) Subject: RE: Your query to Dr. Kadlec Dear Francis, It was a pleasure to hear from you, and yes, it has been a long time since we met or even spoke. Moons ago I was set to write to you after reading your wonderful book, but I ended up instead speaking with others about it. I should add at this point that I did not quickly respond to your email of a few days ago because I simply missed it. It is true that I strongly suggest that OPV be quickly (already it is not quickly) brought forward for induction of a strong innate immune response to prevent or markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severity until the field obtains a proven safe and efficacious vaccine producing a long lasting, adaptive immunity . OPV is very safe (notably for OPV 1 and 3 as bOPV which we will use and completely safe in a vaccinated population), simple, cheap, rather obvious, yet unique among the massive number of vaccines many (maybe most) of which are the same or at least if not exactly the same aiming at the same mechanism (targeting the spike and searching for the putative correlate of neutralizing Abs.). OPV should work for a few months and possibly longer. Also it should be working multip le times so I think could cover more than a few months, giving us time for a proven vaccine of adaptive immunity, which might be very long lasting as is hoped. In the main the WHO comments are correct. Of course we sought and have letters of support from them as well as from many others . Though they are again supportive in their notes to you, there is one item that surprises me. They add that there was no clinical efficacy results as yet. They know or certainly should know that there is plenty of clinical data for this concept with BCG, OPV, and live Measles vaccine. Needless to say this is what turned me on during our regular Global Virus Network (GVN)conference calls. (Incidentally GVN is an organization I have thought of bringing to your attention. I th ink you would find it impressive and useful). I would be happy to share with you the clinical observations with OPV if you wish. 

I would like to take a small diversion, but I suspect you are aware of these things. My colleagues and I respect the WHO because of its representation and because we have colleagues/friends there as well. However, sometimes bureaucracy of a massive degree leads to inaction or even much worse-- political expediency. I won't bother you with details of these unless you ask, but I had such experiences with HTLV-1 which we discovered in 1980 as the 1st human retrovirus and which cause not only the highest incidence of cancer(% of infections) of any virus and other fatal diseases as well but mainly in less developed countries (plus Japan) and again with HIV in 1984. Behavior was not beneficial. Perhaps it will be of relevance in the future because a few at WHO took a position to remove OPV (Sabin) in favor of IPV (Salk) in their polio eradication scheme. It was a huge failure. As my FDA collaborator, Konstantin Chumakov, says "Blessed be Bill Gates" because he saved OPV and saved the day and in so doing has produced a still better OPV. There is indeed data also for BCG as well as live Measles though I know less of the latter. BCG is less available, requires injection, harder to make, not as safe, and we think unlikely to be as effective as OPV. Nonetheless, we favor its use too. The mechanisms will be similar. You asked whether monkey trials are planned. For several reasons definitely not -- though we are planning some monkey experiments, but not large enough for "clinical" conclusions. The main reasons are: 1) cost; 2) that billions not thousands or millions have received OPV safely and in our collective view (and we know the studies pretty well) protection has been clinically shown; 3) In a pandemic we wished to move quickly (so far we must say that has not been achieved). A typical monkey vaccine study will take time, but 4) in this case it would be a huge amount of lost time as monkeys require great doses of polio for infection and monkeys have to be trained to drink their orange juice. It would be hard to imagine that such studies would even give us useful information. On a final digression Francis I have had 36 years of on/off experiences with glycosylated spike proteins-their analyses immunologically and especially regarding use in vaccines and developing neutralizing Abs. I believe it will be a mistake to put most eggs in that basket. The risks: shortened antibody half life; 2) protection NOT correlating with neutralizing Abs; 3) sometimes hazards from them. Admittedly, they might work, but I trust and hope that not everything is going in this bag. If you wish to discuss this again I will be available. Finally, I hd no idea you were into vaccines or SARS-2 nor any part of CoVID-19 disease, but I am very happy to learn this. Thanks.

Wheth er the sender is known or not known, hover over any links before c]jcking and use caution opening attachments. Dear Bob, It's been quite a while since we've chatted. Bob Kadlec asked me to respond to your query about the possible use of OPV to activate innate immunity and provide COVID-19 protection. Has this been tested in a non-human primate model? I note the recommendation below that says a clinical trial is planned - can you tell me more about that? As you can imag ine, we are all flat out on the vaccine development pathway! Franc is The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to prevent SARS-CoV2 (Polio Eradication Campaign) There is no evidence that ora l poliovirus vaccine (OPV) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. A clinical trial address ing this question is planned in the USA, and WHO w ill evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence , WHO does not recommend OPV vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. WHO continues to recommend OPV as part of essentia l immunization services to prevent poliomyeli tis and as part of global polio eradication efforts. There are experimental signals from various studies over the years that OPV has non-spec ific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well charact erized and the ir clinical relevance is unknown. Such non-specific effects may 

not be limited to OPV, as other live vaccines have also been associated with non￾specific protective effects (such as BCG vaccine against tuberculosis). Non live vaccines in contrast do not seem to have the same effects. The exact mechanism of non-specific protection induced by live vaccines needs to be elucidated further. Clinical studies could begin immed iately because the vaccines in question are licensed and have an excellent safety record. Clinical tria ls involving off-label use of various drugs licensed for other indications are currently underway. The existing scientific rationale suggests that the same should be done for OPV and other live vaccines. A study is currently being discussed with various partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the spread of SARS-CoV2 until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.

From the Neighborhood by Frank Derosa Frank DeRosa retired as Associate Publisher of The Tablet and director of the Diocesan Public Information Office in 2008 When I see Dr. Anthony Fauci on the TV screen explaining expertly everything we need to know about the coronavirus pandemic, I find myself thinking back to his father, Stephen Fauci, whose drugstore our family relied on back in the 1950s. Steve Fauci was the neighborhood pharmacist. The Fauci Pharmacy stood on the southwest corner of 13th Ave. and 83 rd St., in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, diagonally across from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. We lived two blocks away on 85 th . 

Long ago parishioners like me remember what the store looked like, the soda fountain that ran along the right wall, the telephone booths at the left close to the entrance and the counter straight ahead down the center. Whenever my mother sent me there, Mr. Fauci would be behind the counter, but it was a family enterprise. They lived in an apartment above the store, and if the patriarch wasn't serving you, his wife, Eugenia, or daughter, Denise, was there. Young Anthony, I've since learned, pitched in too, his father sending him out on his bike to deliver items to customers. I've never met the man who has become the most important medical voice in the country. Nor have former parishioners that I've spoken to about him in recent days, like boyhood pals Anthony LoFrisco, from 80th St., now in Connecticut, and Bob Orlando, who lived on 84th, now a New Jersey resident, as well as Bishop Gerald Barbarito of the Palm Beach Diocese, from 11th Ave. But each remembers the pharmacy as a Dyker Heights institution. 

While we don't know him personally, in a sense he's become everyone's friend. With his steady television presence, he's imparted his vast knowledge and straightforward advice in a trademark, sometimes gravelly or raspy, Brooklyn accent that has endeared him to people far and wide. You can't be anything but proud of someone of his prominence who came from the parish. Anthony became known as Tony, as he tells it, when Father Flanagan, principal of Regis High School, decided to call him that on his first day as a freshman. The name stuck. Tony took buses and trains to the Jesuit school in Manhattan, including the old Sea Beach Express. He traveled 70 minutes each way, did three hours of homework, captained the basketball team and excelled in the classroom. I remember hearing that when Tony was a high schooler, he had a part￾time job working in St. Bernadette's rectory, answering the phone and doing whatever else parishioners wanted him to do to put them in touch with one of the parish priests. In those days, the rectory had a priestly bonanza. There 

were four of them. Because St. Bernadette's School had not yet been established, Tony went to Our Lady of Guadalupe School, where he was taught by Dominican Sisters. It was, and is, St. Bernadette's neighboring parish. Like most kids, he loved sports. He played CYO baseball and basketball. At Dyker Park on 86th St., he and his friends developed skills in imitation of their heroes. A Yankee follower living in the midst of Brooklyn Dodgers fans who adored The Boys of Summer, he's said his favorite players were Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle. Tony's father and mother married at 18, after they graduated from New Utrecht High School. Steve went on to Columbia to study pharmacy. Sometime after he opened his pharmacy, he became friends with Father Al Varriale, one of St. Bernadette's beloved parish priests. At one point, Steve, as a parent, and the priest known as Father V, who directed the parish's robust CYO sports program for youths, shared a concern. It was the easy availability of indecent 

and immoral publications that they knew was a threat to the moral development of young people. So, with the approval and support of the Diocese of Brooklyn, together they formed a diocesan commission against pornography. Both men are now long gone, and so is the commission, but it was a good idea, though it did not survive them. Remarkably, just a few houses up the block from where Steve established his pharmacy, lived the Pellegrinos, another family of St. Bernadette's parishioners that produced a renowned medical professional. The eldest son, Edmund, became a bioethicist, a "preeminent" one, as one newspaper described him after he died. But he was more. He helped develop medical programs at Kentucky, Stony Brook and Tennessee Universities. Later, he took on the presidency of The Catholic University of America. Then, after completing his tenure there, he became, as physician and philosopher, the director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University. Though years apart in age, both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Pellegrino became Hippocratic stars, nurtured on the same block. 

Only in Brooklyn, I say, not without bias. Steve Fauci was known by members of his extended family and friends for his personality, kindness, sense of humor and wit, and for telling good stories. So they said in comments after he died in 2008. Tony appears to have inherited Steve's gene for lightheartedness. His daughter once told the Washington Post that her dad could be a "goofball ... he works hard and does his thing, but he comes home and he's singing opera in the kitchen and dancing around." That kind of calm can help a man maintain his balance as he deals with the pressure of talking to millions of people every day about the complexity of a global pandemic. As one newsman said, "When Fauci appears on the screen, you turn up the volume." He once said the Jesuits at Regis and Holy Cross College taught him the importance of "precision of thought and economy of expression." 

That's what he delivers every day: accurate information given concisely. That's Tony Fauci, now a national treasure. And to think, he came from the neighborhood. Dr. Anthony Fauci TOSLOW EAD He graduated from Regis High School and the College of Holy Cross. He graduated number one in his class at Cornell Medical School in 1966. He completed his medical residency at New York Hospital In 1984, he became director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a position he holds today. Front row, kneeling

Pleas take a look and figure out where to send it. From: Gary Radin <GRadin@dhs.lacounty.gov > Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2020 8:31 PM ------ ~= To: Fauci, Anthony {NIH/NIAID) [E] (b)(6)> -------- Subject: Another Possible Tool in The Fight Against SARS-CoV-2 ? Dr. Fauci---Forgive the crude and unsolicited manner in which I am attempting to reach out to you but I don't reall y KNOW any other way! I am not a medical doctor nor am I a principle investigator. I am just a Cytologist employed in the Anatomic Pathology department at LA County-USC Medical Center here in Southern California. But I have been reading a lot--- and in my own exploration I have come across several articles which suggest the possibility of using a class of agents called SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR AGONISTS in combination with antivirals like oseltamivir (or perhaps Remdesivir?) to treat both the viral pathogen responsibl e for the current pandemic as well as the runaway immune response of the host leading to the oft fatal cytokine storms. Apparently these compounds have been approved for flare-ups of multiple sclerosis, and have even been tried on Alzheimer's patients. The commonly known drug is FINGOLIMOD. But these papers that I have cited for you below seem to indicate that structural analogs of this compound could be important in damping down the dysregulated pro -inflammatory cascades which seem to be leading to DIC, alveolar exudates and diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak syndrome and ultimately the multiple organ failure that is killing an unacceptably high number of people. The fly in the ointment Dr. Fauci here is that these 5-1-PR agonists have only been demonstrated to be effective in non-human primates and other mammals. And much of these studies on these compounds has been done not on coronaviruses but on influenza viruses . So it would be a gamble. But is that not how we have learned much about human health and disease is by the gracious sacrifice of our anim al cousins? And might it not be a general effect that these sphingosine derivat ives have on viral sepsis so that maybe what works for influenza might work for the coronavirus? In the dire situation that many of the most critically ill COVID 19 patien ts find themselves, it seems they are on the precipice of a rapid demise once they begin to show certain key laboratory results---(sp ikes in 0-DIMER, C-Reactive Protein, Serum Ferritin, prolongation of 

prothrombin and APTT, increased cardiac troponin 1, surges in IL-6, IL-7, monocytic and macrophage chemo-attractant cytokines etc). With pat ients isolated by these aberrant lab values, the window may be narrow but it may be a time where application of antiviral compounds in combination with t hese inflamma tory mod ulat ors could have a striking impact on mort ality? Indeed maybe even TWO different antivirals with diff ering mechanisms of action in combination with these S1-PR Agonists would even be better. And the possibilit ies of other combinat ions of course would be there for further exploration . Fully cognizant of the Hippocratic Oath to 'first do no harm' I still believe that at least the medical rat ionale is sound for the inclusio n of these agents into the possible arsenal of therapeutics for the more severe COVID 19 patients. Please refer below to the st udies I found particularly helpful or promis ing. Perhaps you can put together some 'teams ' to further explore investigate these opt ions?? We all appreciate everyt hing you have done, and continue to do !

Dear Francis, I hope you are well. I write on behalf of a group of citizen -scientists, most or all of whom you know. Motivated solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces, we wrote a set of four actionable, non-partisan proposa Is (attached) to produce safe and effective COVID-19 therapeut ics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks . We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willing to share this set of proposa ls with Dr. Tony Fauci, along with our willingness to discuss any part of the proposals with him if we can be helpful. We understand from our efforts to contact Dr. Fauci through emai l routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed for our proposa l to reach him. The four proposals attached describe: (1) How to rapid ly repurpose an ant iviral drug to treat COVID-19 patients; (2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to treat patients and to provide short-term protect ion for healthy individuals; (3) How to develop COVID-19 vaccines on an expedited t ime scale; and (4) How to reopen our businesses and schools in a manner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths.

As an American, a former colleague, a long-time admirer and student of your wisdom - thank you. We are all safer because of you, and the world will be a better place because of you. Again. As you know, I am now leading the ONE Campaign. We've been quite active wi th the ONEWorld Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on Africa . We've made some progress on debt, and next up is a focus on ensuring that a vaccine, when it comes, is available to everyone. One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work. It won't surp rise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and information get to people across the continent, but we also know that more facts are needed everywhere . So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic, where every day for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or her social media channels over to an expert on COVID-19 for one day. So Julia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk about the critical elements needed to flatten the curve and slow the spread. Or Idris Elba could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the impact COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world . We know artists want to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact . As we look ahead we know COVID-19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere 

we are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turn ing over their platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donating one of their biggest assets - their followers - to YOU, giving you the platform you need (and we all need) to tell the world why a global response is critical. Because none of us are safe until all of us are safe. We wi ll work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our celebrity partners' audiences - in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create content that both part ies are happy with . We are now confirming our talent partners, and so far are getting a terrific response. We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end would be minimal. But the impact wou ld be maximal. I'm attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you think and if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so are hoping to confirm folks by April 28th at the latest. Our team will be in touch with your office to follow up. Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

The need for platelet donations is especially acute now with the coronavirus pandemic. While social distancing and increased telework are necessary to contain and slow the spread of coronavirus, we have seen a marked decline in platelet and blood donations for our patients. To alleviate this shortage, NIAID and the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) are co-sponsoring a two-week Platelet Drive from March 30 -April 10. Platelet collections, as well as whole blood and Double Red Cell donations, can only be made at the NIH Blood Bank on campus in Building 10, Room 1(713 Monday through Friday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The Platelet Center at Fishers lane is temporarily closed and plate let collections are now on the main campus through at least the next 30 days. This move helps to ensure that blood donors are protected by visitor screening, minimizing possible exposure to individuals at risk. What is a double red cell donation? A double red cell donation enables donors to donate two units of red blood cells in one visit. During a procedure called apheresis, whole blood is separated through a cell separator and red blood cells are collected. The remainder of the blood components are returned to the donor along with saline to replace the lost volume. I encourage participation of all employees who are eligible to provide a donation to benefit our NIH patients. I understand employees may be hesitant to participate under the current conditions, but I would like to reassure you that blood donation is a safe process. Additiona l precautions have been put in place at our Blood Bank to help prevent the spread of infection and protect the health of donors and staff . Thank you to all who support our quarterly platelet drives. Your efforts provide a lifeline for our patients . Those who participated in the last drive are now eligible to help once again. In appreciation of your dedication to helping others, NIAID grants administrative leave to any NIAID federal employee who donates platelets at the NIH Blood Bank. Specifically, you will be granted 4 hours of administrative leave to be used immediately following your platelet donation appointment. As always with such activities, please notify your supervisor for approval prior to donating at the NIH Platelet Center .. Contractor employees should speak directly to their contract companies to determine what leave 

options are available . Please contact the Donor Center at 301-496-4321 to schedule your appointment. let the Donor Center staff know you are with t he NIAID Platelet/Double Red Cell Drive. They will answer eligibility questions and provide information about the donation process. Thank you for considering donat ing during this stressful time. Best regards. Sincerely, A.S.

Our understanding is that state or local ju risdictions will be able to develop their own workfor ces rather than supporting a single workforce at the federal level, and we agree with this approach , but it would be very helpfu l to understand next steps and potential timelines, particularly as the reopening drumbeat gets louder. For example, Chicago has developed a local plan/proposal (attached) that would meet our local needs, help address some of our underlying race and economic equity concerns, and build on our existing community and clinical partnerships. We have shared it with some partners, but it is not at all clear how/whether/when/how much funding might be available. Given the need to quickly expand our workforce and plan ahead, it would be very helpful to get a sense of: a. How much funding/support might be available, and how that will be determined b. Whether funding might come through HHS/CDC (our preferred mechanism), FEMA, or another mechanism c. Will support be available in weeks or months ... and for how long-we are strongly advocating for 5 years, similar to what was done for Ebola d. Any other information about how our local or state plans need to be adapted to fit into federal thinking on this approach Thank you so much; I deeply apprec iate Dr. Fauci taking the time to meet with us directly and hear our concerns.

I've provided bullets below to capture the main points. Please add or change as needed. I've kept this relatively short but can supply a full recording of the call if you want it. We will have another call next Tuesday. David PPE supplies: - whi le hospitals are in better shape than a few weeks ago, significant shortages remain at long￾term care facilitates, skilled nursing facilitates , outpatient settings like doctors' offices and urgent care clinics, shelters, prisons. Gowns are the biggest problem, but gloves, masks and shields are also short. Doctors offices are closing for lack of PPE. - each city is trying to solve these shortages in a short-term , piecemeal way. They need a longe r￾term solution to stabilize availability. Outpatient settings are looking to health departments to provide supplies , something HDs are not set up to do. - testing in most places still requires PPE use (e.g. no avai lability of anterior nasal swabs) and the PPE shortages are severely limiting testing scale up. - even at hospitals, supply limitations make re-opening elective surgerie s and other procedures impossible at this stage. - If considering re-opening businesses, this will drastically increase PPE needs to a whole new sector. TESTING challenges: - Each city reported that, despite improvements, a very limited number of tests are being perfom1ed compared to need. - Supply shortages are the biggest challenge: swabs, PPE, sample kits, reagents are the biggest obstacles. Not clear where this is going to come from or who is responsible for addressing problems. - Private labs limit number of sample kits distributed each week. In places where public labs are available, there is a push to get providers to use the public labs. But many places don't have public labs. - There is no clear guidance on how to prioritize who gets tested first. So, in some places, that means that people at lower-risk are being testing but people at greater risk (due to symptoms, 

exposure , high-risk living/work environment, etc) are not being testing. Guidelines are needed to help prioritize where testing resources are used first. - Public testing produces skewed results . Testing becomes available only to those who can make an appointment and who can drive to the site. This means many lower￾priority people get tested but high-priority people do not. This skews understanding of positivity rates. - Some labs are underutilized - but the reason is that there are breakdowns in the supply chain that make it difficult to test people and get tests to the labs. (e.g .) (b) <4) - Reimbursement is an obstacle. CMS offering to cover test costs ($100 per test) would help get labs to do more testing. It would not solve the problem , but it would help. - Proliferation of unvalidated antibody tests is causing confusion. High rates of false results, misinterpretation of what results mean ( e .g. telling people who test antibody positive that they must quarantine for two weeks). Chicago spends a lot time shutting down these testing sites as they make things harder and use up supplies. - there is increasing pressure to reach a target nwnber of tests performed each day in order to get to 're-opening'. But the number needed is contextual based on the environment, population - there isn't one 'right' number for everywhere. - Need better public messaging on difference between virology and serologic tests. - Current testing capacity is no where near what is needed to make informed decisions about re￾operung. TESTING: reporting challenges - CwTent PoC tests have no link to provide results to health departments . Many outpatient facilities and SNFs have no system for reporting test results to HDs. Need electronic link for reporting PoC test results. - While aggregate positive tests may be reported, negative result'> are not. - Impossible to really understand population levels of infection because ( 1) number of tests perfom1ed is too low and (2) not testing the 'right' people - Every one is pushing for rapid scale up of antibody tests, but we still don't know what the results of these tests mean and bow to apply them to policy development. - CDC and NIH will each coordinate sere-surveys. No details on CDC approach yet. NIH study is up. Still not clear how to use the results of these studies, but useful to collect data now and apply it as knowledg e grows. Locally-coordinate aero-surveys can be helpful but only if tests are highly validated . The Future: - How many tests should we being doing?

• The most aggressive strains of Sars-CoV-2 could generate 270 times as much viral load as the least potent type • New York may have a deadlier strain imported from Europe, compared to less deadly viruses elsewhere in the United States Stephen Chen in Beijing Published: 10:41pm, 20 Apr, 2020 Updated: 1:33am, 21 Apr, 2020 A team led by Professor Li Lanjuan has studied how the novel coronavirus mutates and possible implications for the pandemic . Photo: EPA-EFE A new study by one of China's top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirus to mutate has been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts of the disease in various parts of the wor ld. Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients many mutations not previously reported. These muta tions included changes so rare that scientists had never considered they might occur. They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create strains deadlier than others. "Sars-CoV-2 has acquired mutat ions capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity, " Li and her collaborators wrote in a non-peer reviewed paper released on preprint service medRxiv.org on Sunday. Li's study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused disease or damage in its host. Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation. She analysed the viral strains isolated from 11 randomly chosen Covid-19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells. The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe, while the milder strains were the predominant varieties found in parts of the United States, such as Washington state, according to their paper. A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe. The death rate in New York was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse. But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li's study. In Zhejiang, two pat ients in their 30s and 50s who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit. This finding could shed light on differences in regiona l mortality. The pandemic's infection and death rates vary from one country to another, and many explanations have been proposed. Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations but they had no direct proof . 

The issue was further complicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age, underlying health conditions or even blood type. In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region might determine actions to fight the virus . "Drug and vaccine development , while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations ... into account to avoid potential pitfalls," they said. Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown ,according to state media reports. The government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11 million residents was shut down overnight. The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small. Other studies tracking the virus mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, of strains. Li's team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations - or about 60 per cent - were new. They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus' spike protein, a unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavir us to bind with human cells. Computer simulation pred icted that these mutations would increase its infectivity. To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutat ions. The most aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also kil led the cells the fastest. It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, "indicating that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underapprecia ted," Li wrote in the paper. -- Professor Li Lanjuan is a leading Chinese epidemiologist. Photo: Xinhua The mutat ions were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuha n, where the virus was first detected in late December last year. The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month . By Monday, more than 10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300 mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation. Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach t hat could generate a result quickly . The genes were read just once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes. 

Li's team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have been over looked by the conventional approach. The researchers also found three consecutive changes - known as tri-nucleotide mutations - in a 60- year-old patient , which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces were infectious with living viral strains. "Investigating the functiona l impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting," Li and colleagues said in the paper. Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Informat ion Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective strategy to track the virus' mutation. "It can produce some useful information," he said. But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all samples. "Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow," Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in many others still left scientists scratching their heads. "If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don't be surprised."

Rick Bright HHS WASHINGTON - Rick Bright, one of the nation's leading vaccine development experts and the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authori ty, is no longer leading the organization, officials to ld STAT. The shakeup at the agency, known as BARDA, couldn't come at a more inopportune time for the office, which invests in drugs, devices, and other technologies that help address infectious disease out breaks and which has been at the center of the government's coronaviru s pandemic response. Bright, whose departure was confirmed by th ree industry sources and two current Trump admin istration sources, will instead move into a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health overseeing a similar but lim ited public-pr ivate partnership aimed at vaccine development. Gary Disbrow, Bright's former deputy at BARDA, wi ll serve as the acting director of the office, an HHS spokesperson confirmed to STAT. BARDA was expected to play an even larger role in the coming months; Congress more than tripled BARDA's budget in the most recent coronavirus stimulus package. Already, the office has a role in some of the splashiest Covid-19 projects, including partnerships with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Therapeut ics, both of which are developing potent ial Covid-19 treatments . Related: This tiny federal agency was built to respond to a crisis like coronavirus. Now that it's here, is BARDA ready? BARDA has been plagued with management issues virtually since its creation in 2006, with much of the criticism aimed at a contracting department that some say is unresponsive to industry partners. The office has only had two permanent directo rs since its creation in 2006. Bright has led the organization since 2016. None of the sources articu lated the reason for Bright's departure, though several mentioned recent chafing between Bright and Bob Kadlec, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, which has oversight over BARDA. An HHS spokesperson confirmed that Bright will work on a recently announced NIH public-private partnership with 16 drug makers aimed at develop ing vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. "Dr. Rick Bright will transfer the skills he has applied as Director of the [BARDA) to the [NIH) .... Dr. Bright brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public-private partnerships tha t advance the health and well -being of the American people," the spokesperson said. Bright did not immed iately respond to requests for comment. Bright's career has largely centered around vaccine and drug development . His work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focused on influenza viruses, antiviral drugs and tests . He has also worked in the biotechnology industry and served as an advisor to the World Health Organization. Before becoming BARDA director, he led the agency's Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division. Lev Facher contributed reporting.

Stephen Chen in Beijing Published: 10:41pm, 20 Apr, 2020 Updated: 1:33am, 21 Apr, 2020 A team led by Professor Li Lanjuan has studied how the novel coronavirus mutates and possible implications for the pandemic. Photo: EPA-EFE A new study by one of China's top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirus to mutate has been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts of the disease in various parts of the world. Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients many mutations not previously reported . These mutations included changes so rare that scientists had never considered they might occur. They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create strains deadlier than others. "Sars-CoV-2 has acquired mutat ions capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity," Li and her collaborators wrote in a non-peer reviewed paper released on preprint service medRxiv.org on Sunday. Li's study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused disease or damage in its host. Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation . She analysed the viral strains isolated from 11 randomly chosen Covid-19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells. The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe, while the milder strains were the predomina nt varieties found in parts of the United States, such as Washington state, according to their paper. A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe. The death rate in New York was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse . But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li's study . In Zhejiang, two patients in their 30s and 50s who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit . This finding could shed light on differences in regional mortality . The pandemic's infection and death rates vary from one country to another , and many explanations have been proposed . Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations but they had no direct proof. The issue was further complicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age, underlying health conditions or even blood type . In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region might determine actions to fight the virus . "Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations ... into account to avoid pote ntial pitfalls," they said. 

Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown.accord ing to state media reports. The government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11 million residents was shut down overnight. The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small. Other studies tracking the virus mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, of strains. Li's team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations - or about 60 per cent - were new . They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus' spike protein, a unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavir us to bind with human cells. Computer simulation pred icted that these mutations would increase its infectivity . To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutat ions. The most aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also killed the cells the fastest. It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, "ind icating that the true diversity of the viral strains is still largely underappreciated," Li wrote in the paper. - Professor Li Lanjuan is a leading Chinese epidemiologist. Photo: Xinhua The mutat ions were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in late December last year. The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than 10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300 mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation. Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result quickly. The genes were read just once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes. Li's team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have been overlooked by the conventional approach. The researchers also found three consecutive changes - known as tri-nucleotide mutations - in a 60- year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces were infectious with living viral strains. 

"Investigating the functiona l impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting," Li and colleagues said in the paper. Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective strategy to track the virus' mutation. "It can produce some useful info rmation," he said. But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all samples. "Our understanding of the virus remains quite shallow," Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectab le symptoms in many others still left scientists scratching their heads. "If there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don't be surprised."

I can't even begin to imagine how difficult it is to maintain your composure and persevere with your focus, being constan t ly in the public eye and also trying to expertly guide a president who seems more preoccupie d with his own image (and sound of his own voice), and political aspirations than with the actual well being of his country's citizens. By now, it should be perfectly clear to us that we can't have a healthy economy without a healthy population.

(b)(6) is the only one of us who occasionally goes to a grocery store or drug store if necessary and then, he always wears a mask, gloves, and keeps at least six feet between himself and anyone else, and gets in and out as quickly as possible. In addit ion, (b)(6) - are so inten t on keeping me well and alive, we haven1 t even, any of us, physically visited with each other, in person, inside our house for months. In the past two months , I've been outside only four times - twice on our deck and twice in my car1 dropping off a couple of shopping bags at a friend's house and at (bH6l - both times leaving the bags in the driveway, -------------- and then driving right back home. I'm so thankful for FaceTime, but we miss hugs and kisses. I know all this must sound extreme , and it is, but I'm terr ified of becoming a statistic so we're doing wh af_e,ver we._.ca o_to_sia~he.aJtb.._v..fnr nu r.selve_c;_and on e._.anoib e .__ _____ ~~ (b)(6) (b)(6) My family is hearing what you're saying and taking your advice. ------- 1' m sorry this email is so long but my intention , more than anything, is to thank you fo r your wisdom and advice, both grounded in years of experience. I worked at NIH for about 25 years - in the CC, in NCI, and in Human Genome. I met you once, briefly , about 40 years ago(+/-) in Bldg. 31's fitness room . I had been working in the CC, in the Patient Activities Dep't. (on the POB out- and in￾patient units)at the time. I was incorrectly using a piece of equipment and you were kind enough to come over and show me the correct way to use it. I recognized you immediately , and have never forgotten that experience and how gracious you were. 

I'm well aware from the news that you are up against some very tough people and some very tough times but please know you also have an army of grateful followers in this country who are completely convinced that what you are advising is in their very best interest . Thank you again for all you've done for all of us over the years. My family and I are more grateful than I can express. PS I read all about your wife who sounds amazing also. You two make an "All - Star" team. Be well. Gratefully, Joan ("Joanie") Hussey Sent from my iPhone

How Fordham has produced a generation of sports media stars April 19, 2020 I 4:04pm I Updated April 19. 2020 I 9:16pm 

John Giannone, Michael Kay and Mike Breen; Chris Carrino Courtesy of Michael Kay, Chris Carrino Long before he was an electee to the Basketball Hall of Fame , Mike Breen was an intimidated 18-year-old freshman attending a workshop at Fordham's renowned college radio station, WFUV, in the fall of 1979. Breen felt sheepish next to the juniors and seniors leading the seminar and contemplated delaying the start of his broadcasting training. Soon, a couple of upperclassmen, including future NBA writer Dave D' Alesandro, made him feel more comfortable. But he still didn't have any friends until one day on campus he saw a confident sophomore trying to sweet talk a young woman. "I know you like me," he said. "I can see it in your eyes." The woman responded by saying she would not date him if he were the last man on earth. She essentially was saying, "See ya" ... to Michael Kay. That is how Breen first became friends with Kay. "For him to have the confidence to do this in front of everybody with this beautiful student, I thought, 'Man, this guy has a great sense of humor,'" Breen said. Four decades later, Breen and Kay are still good friends. 

Michael Kay and Mike Breen Courtesy of Michael Kay Fordham, the private Jesuit university in The Bronx that launched the legendary Vin Scully, for decades has been a powerhouse sportscasting pipeline , especially in New York. And the school ties that first united Breen and Kay are webbed throughout the industry. Fordham is the alma mater for the voice of the NBA Finals/Knicks (Breen, Class of 1983), the Yankees' lead TV play-by-player/ESPN New York afternoon radio host (Kay, '82), the voice of the Giants (Bob Papa, '8 6), the radio voice of the Nets (Chris Carrino , '92) MSG 's John Giannone ('86) , YES' Jack Curry ('86) , WFAN's Paul Dottino ('86) and YES/ESPN's Ryan Ruocco ('08). And that's just New York-based sportscasters. For good measure, the school produced CBS' Spero Dedes ('01), ESPN's Tony Reali ('00) and the Washington Nationals' Charlie Slowes ('83). There are many more, and not just in front of the camera. If you need a field producer, Jim Johnson ('86) works for ESPN. A radio engineer? WF AN's Chris Majkowski ('89) will set things up. Media relations? Louis Ban-icelli ('09) is leading things at MLB Network. Like everyone else, they are all dealing with the halt of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is a jan-ing timeout for people so used to being on the run. 

~ Ryan Ruocco, Mike Breen Courtesy of Ryan Ruocco Take Carrino, who has done so much to raise money and awareness for facio scapulo humeral dystrophy (FSHD), a form of muscular dystrophy that afflicts him. A fundraising event was supposed to take place in March at a Ne ts game at Barclays Center. His 10th annual fundraising dinner, corresponding with his 50th bi1thday, was slated for August, and now is in question. "I don't know if it is going to be safe to have people together still," Carrino said. "Are the restrictions going to be there in terms of how many people can gather in one place? The other aspect of it for me is: How comfortab le am I asking people for money when I know the economy and certain businesses are affected so badly?" Ruocco was supposed to get married in Italy in June. He and his fiancee, Andrea Ferzoco, are now going to punt the wedding until June 2021. "It sucks," Ruocco said. "Arldrea and I were so excited and so were our guests. We have been feeling all the joy leading us to this. There are people dealing with much more dire circumstances than rescheduling a wedding. That is kind of the perspec tive we have tried to take." While most of the successful sports media alumni are worried about the current direction of Fordham and WFUV because of a de-emphasis on sports during the pandemic , to a man they say how Fordham molded them and led them to where they are today. They were helped by famous names such as the legendary Marty Glickman, a mentor , and Stan Fischler, who taught classes. Then there were the less famous, equa lly instrwnental figures in the program, such as Bob Ahrens, who ran WFUV as its executive producer during many of these notable students' formative years. 

John Giannone punting at FordhamCourtesy of John Giannone The experiences that they shared forged many of them , such as Breen and Kay, into close friends. Giannone went to Fordham after being recruited to be a punter on the football team. During training camp his freshman year, he quickly figured out the third-string punter would never see the field. He went to Kay, then the WFUV sports director as a senior, to try to help on the station. Kay said Giannone could do stats for him during the football season. Kay went on to work at The Post, and later helped Giannone land an entry-level position at the paper. When Giannone transferred into television at CNN/Sports Illu strated, it was through a Kay connection. And Giannone landed at MSG Network after Kay left to become the TV voice of the Yankees when YES Network began. When it was Giannone's turn as WFUV spo rts director, he made Papa and Curry a play-by￾player and an analyst when they were sophomore s. WFUV also got its staff access to locker rooms at places like Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden to learn the craft next to profes siona ls at the highest level. That remains largely true today. "WFUV allowed you to believe you were a profes sional broadcaster before you really were," Curry said. "We were in the heart of New York City, and, even ifwe weren't Marv Albert, we felt as if what Marv Albert was doing for the Knicks, we were doing for Fordham." There is a lineage that unites. Carrino learned how to describe the geography of a basketball court from Glickman. Later , Carrino returned to Fordham and taught Ruocco the same lessons. These days, at some Nets games, Ruocco is on TV, sitting next to Carrino, calling the game on the radio. 

Jack Curry Courtesy of Jack Curry Papa also was mentored by Glickman. Papa and Carrino each were told by their fathers that if they majored in communications, they would have to pay for schoo l themselves. Both ended up in the Business School, but had their eyes on WFUV the whole time. Carrino ended up working as a producer for Papa, beginning when Papa hosted a tailgate show on WF AN. Carrino eventually followed Papa as the radio voice of the Nets. The Fordham sports alums want everyone to be safe during this time - and they can't wait to get back to what they love to do. "I'm desperate to get back to work," Breen said. "I'm hoping there is NBA basketball. This is the best time of the year."

It, in my opinion, reads really well . I have embellished it today with a figure that conceptual ly outlines what we are talking about; the old axiom that a picture is worth a thousand words . The editorial guidelines of the NEJM has 2 potential categories. One is Perspectives which is 1200 words an 5 references . We are at 1750 words and I think losing 500 words takes away a lot from the message . The other category is a special report wh ich is over 2500 words and allows lots of references ( 40) I think this is best and was one reason I thought about adding the conceptua l figure which does outli ne in a single picture what we are talking about . Tony, If you feel its best to have Francis on this paper we both support it . Your call . I do however lean on includ ing Francis . I would say politicly to achieve our goal and bring all these companies into the ten t while you are away at the White House having him buy into this plan through the ACTIV prog ram seems important to us . I think we get to our goal if he is out there publ icly embracing this; using the NIAID networks labs DSMB and the correlates programs . This type of granularity really puts him deep into understanding what we are doing . If this means you are first and he is last author we are ok with that, For me I need to have him use me for interfacing with the company in defining these collabo rations . If you were present all the time this would be unnecessary , but as he will be the link with BARDA linking him to John and I increases the likelihood of success. 

Ok enough .. as they say on the news Goodnight .. Larry (b)(6)

I don't know if you saw Friday's announcement (attached) of the new public private partne rship called ACTIV (for Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1 - 3 of your letter. I share your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of course we want to test multiple other interventions - both small molecules and antibody-based therapies, so we need our trial system to be optimized like never before. I will share your letter with the leaders of ACTIV, who are working with unprecedented speed to prio ritize the next set of therapeutic candidates as well as pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial designs to test safety and efficacy (with fu ll engagement by FDA).

I write on behalf of a group of citizen-scientists, most or all of whom you know. Motivated solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces, we wrote a set of four actionable, non-partisan proposals (attached) to produce safe and effective COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willing to share this set of proposals with Dr. Tony Fauci, along with our willingness to discuss any part of the 

proposals with him if we can be helpful. We understand from our efforts to contact Dr. Fauci through email routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed for our proposal to reach him. The four proposals attached describe: (1) How to rapid ly repurpose an antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 patients; (2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to treat patients and to provide short-term protect ion for healthy individuals; (3) How to develop COVID-19 vaccines on an expedited time scale; and (4) How to reopen our businesses and schools in a manner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths. Thank you for any help or thoughts you might be able to provide.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administrat ion announced a further expansion of COVID-19 testing options through the recognition that spun synthetic swabs- with a design similar to Q-tips - could be used to test patients by collecting a sample from the front of the nose. As part of this effort, U.S. Cotton, the largest manufacturer of cotton swabs and a subsidiary of Parkdale-Mills, developed a polyester-based Q-tip-type swab that is fully synthetic for compat ibility with COVID-19 testing. Harnessing its large-scale U.S.-based manufacturing capabil ities, U.S. Cotton plans to produce these new polyester swabs in large quantities to help meet the needs for coronavirus diagnostic testing. "This action today demonstrates the ingenuity that results from the FDA working in partnership with the private sector. The Trump Administration has been working side-by-side with our industry partners to fight this pandemic, and today is a great example of that work. We appreciate work by UnitedHealth Group, Quantigen, and the Gates Foundation to perform and support the clinical studies necessary for this advancement. We also want to acknowledge U.S. Cotton's efforts to manufacture a new type of swab for COVID-19 testing tha t can be produced at scale. We appreciate the work of these collaborators to consider how these test supplies could be broadly distributed to meet not only the testing needs of the United States but also global needs around the pandemic. All of these actions by these American organizations will help continue to expand our testing capability," said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. This finding that spun synthetic swabs could be used for COVID-19 test ing is based on results from a clinical investigation that represents a collaboration between the FDA, UnitedHealth Group, the Gates Foundation, and Quant igen. The type of test ing at the front of the nose used in th is study is notable because it allows self-collection by patients the reby limiting exposure of healthcare providers; it is more comfortable for patients and it can be performed by a swab that is more readily available and manufacturab le at scale.

Sorry for the broad distribution but I wanted to make sure that my message reaches you. Similarly as has been described earlier for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV (Channappanavar & Perlman, 2017), H5Nl and some heavy HlNl Influenza A infections, also COVID-19 patients have been reported to show significantly increased systemic cytok ine release (i.e. cytoki ne storm), particularly those patients with lung failure or systemic organ failure (Chao/in Huang et al. Lance t vol 395, 2020, ref 1). Previous studies at Virologik GmbH, Erlangen, Germany, in colabo ration with the Friedrich-Loeffler￾lnstitut, Tuebingen, Germany have shown, that HSNl (or alternatively LPS) -induced Cytokine storm in vivo can be inhibited by application of Proteasome Inhibitors (E. Haasbach et al, Antivira l Res. 91, 2011, ref. 2), via the inhibition of translocation ofthe NF-icB transcription factor to the nucleus (see Fig. below ). The mechanism of NF-KB inhibition by proteasome inhibitors is well described, and works via the inhibition of t he protea soma I degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IKB, this way keeping NF-KB bound in the cytosol and there by inhibiting the otherwi se induced (by cytokine or LPS- or RNA virus) translocat ion of NF-KB to the nucleus where it would initiate the transcr ipt ion of many cytok ines. This effect of proteasome inhibitors seems to wo rk in most cell ty pes, we could demonstrate this effect in several different cell types (including macrophages) after stimulation w ith TN Fa in vitro and in HSNl (or LPS) treated mice in vivo (see manuscript and Figs. attached) . Inhibition of NF-KB by proteasome inhibitors provides the unique potential to inhibit the release of many cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly pro inflammatory cytokines IL-lex., IL-6, TNFa., MIP￾1fL.) (whereas some other cytokines involved in ant iviral immune response, such as IFNy probably seem to be not/less affected (because of diffe rent transcription pathway) . 

Importantly, beside t he anti-inflammatory activity, proteasome inhibitors showed also significant anti￾fibrot ic activity (Lueftenegger et al., manuscript and figs attached) , which may be also important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with heavy lung disease. Furthermore, there have been several publications showing tha t in particular early phases of the replication cycle of Corona virus seem to be dependent on interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) of the host cell, and were effectively inhibited by selective 20S proteasome inhibitors (such as Velcade) (Wang et al. Viro logy J 2010 , 7:99 (ref. 3}; M. Raaben et al. J. Virology, 84(15), 2010, ref. 4). There are several registered proteasome inhibito rs (Bortezomib (Velcade Gt) e.g. produced by Mill ennium Pharmaceuticals (i.e Takeda Oncology); Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®), lxazomib (Ninlaro ®)) for treatment of multiple myeloma and Mantel cell lymphoma, i.e. there are registered drugs with well known side effects available to be tested in small clinical studies for evaluation of their therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients with heavy lung disease and other organ failure. Noteworthy: in contrast to the chronical oncological indications where up to 8 trea tment cycles (and sometimes even more) are applied, it seems plausible that just one or two treatment cycles of proteasome inhibitors might be sufficient to downregulate the cytok ine storm in COVID-19 patients, which would be associated also with much lower side effects. Early first experience on efficacy could be gained from compassionate use applications in heavily ill COVID-19 patients very quickly. Beside the registered application forms, i.e. infusions, probab ly also inhalative application should be tested as well, because it may be better suited to reach the respective target cells in the lung, i.e. alveolar epithelial cell and alveolar macrophages. There are multiple inhalative devices available, e.g. the Handyhaler by Boehringer lngelheim used for Spiriva (for COPD treatment). Alt hough t here are still many open questions, the potential to control the cytokine storm-induced heavy lung and other organ failure by using already registered drugs, ie. proteasome inhibitors may be a real chance to get an additional treatment option , hopefully decreasing the cases necessary for artificial aeration. Please forward this mail to the colleages you consider relevant for evaluation, discussion and consideration for your clinical strategy for COVID-19. Please let me know if additional info rmations are necessary. To my person: I have MD PhD degree and have many years experience in pharmaceutical development (Boehringer lngelheim ), Biotech (lgeneon, Aphton, Virologik GmbH) (for reference see also PubMed Kircheis r) currently leading R&D activities at Syntacoll (part of lnnocoll).

Epub 2011 Jul 13. Antiviral activity of the proteasome inhibitor VL-01 against influenza A viruses. Haasbach E1, Pauli EK, Sprange r R, Mitzner D, Schubert U, Kircheis R, Planz 0. Author information Abstract The appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses of the H5N1 subtype being able to infect humans and the 2009 H1 N1 pandemic reveals the urgent need for new and efficient countermeasures against these viruses . The long-term efficacy of current antivirals is often limited , because of the emergence of drug-resistant virus mutants. A growing understanding of the virus-host interaction raises the possibility to explore alternative targets involved in the viral replication. In the present study we show that the proteasome inhibitor VL-01 leads to reduction of influenza virus replication in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) as demonstrated with three different influenza virus strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1 N1) (EC50 value of 1.7 µM}, A/Regensburg/O6/09 (H1 N1 v) (ECSO value of 2.4 µM) and A/Mallard/Bavaria/1 /2006 (H5N1) (EC50 value of 0.8 µM). In in vivo experiments we could demonstrate that VL-01-aerosol-treatment of BALB/c mice with 14.1 mg/kg results in no toxic side effects, reduced progeny virus titers in the lung (1.1 ± 0.3 log10 pfu) and enhanced survival of mice after infection with a 5-fold MLD50 of the human influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1 N1) up to 50%. Furthermore, treatmen t of mice with 

VL-01 reduced the cytokine release of IL-a/~, IL-6, MIP-1 ~. RANTES and TNF-a induced by LPS or highly pathogen avian HSN1 influenza A virus. The present data demonstrates an antiviral effect of VL-01 in vitro and in vivo and the ability to reduce influenza virus induced cytokines and chemokines. Copyright© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work. It won 't surprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and information get to people across the continent, but we also know t hat more facts are needed everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic, where every day for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or her social media channels over to an expert on COVID-19 for one day. So Julia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk about the critical elements needed to flatten the curve and slow the spread. Or Idris Elba could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the impact COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world . We know artists wan t to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we look ahead we know COVID-19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere we are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning over th eir platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donat ing one of their biggest assets - their followers - to YOU, giving you the platfo rm you need (and we all need) to tell the world why a global response is critical. Because none of us are safe unt il all of us are safe. 

We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our celebrity partners' audiences - in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create content that both parties are happy with. We are now confirming our talent part ners, and so far are getting a terrific response . We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end would be minimal.

Heyman Service to America Medals (Sammies ). I'm writing a Federal Insid er column about th e finalists and would like arrange a telephone interview with your for the story. My questions include : Why did you join th e federal service? Is ther e one example or anecdote that makes you particularly proud of you work? What do you like most about your job? What do you like least about your job? Why would you recommend, or not, your agency and/or the federal governmen t to those seeking career advice? I know this is an incred ibly bus y time for you. I appreciate that th e life and death issues related to the coronavirus are more important than any award. Nonetheless, I hope you 

can spare 10 or 15 minutes for a telephone interview on Tuesday or Wednesday, April 28 or 29. I can also make other days that week work. Thank you.

I hope you are fine. Apologies to dist urb you but it may be of your interest . I saw in the web that you {NIAID/Fauci)( https ://investor.

I collaborated with Fabrizio Cantini {he reads in cc), a reumathologist of Prato to write a letter to J Infection {pdf attached). He conducted an off- label study in patients with mild -moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 [(SpO2) >92% at room -air, and rat io arterial oxygen part ial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen {PaO2/FiO2) 100-300 mm Hg] to evaluate the impact ofbaritinib {tablet 4 mg/day) in terms of safety, clinical respiratory improvements, discharge, ICU tr ansfer in 2 we eks; these pati ents received also lopinavir/ritonavi r therapy. The last consecutive patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia receiving standa rd of care therapy (lopinavir/ri tonavir and hydroxychloroquine) admitted before the date of the first baricitinib -treated patient served as controls. 

The results of this off-label study, with the limit of not been a RCT, are encouraging: 1. Safety: only 1/12 case of transaminase elevation at day 10, likely due to lopinavir ritonavir co￾administration because baricitinib is mainly renal secreted 2.

It is only to express all my gratitude for what you have done in your life to fight infectious diseases and what you are doing now for COVID-19. Your efforts and achievement are in front of the whole world and for me it is a great honor to have been with you in 1992-1996 at the time of HIV fight. As I told you many times , you are a model of excellence! Only to keep you updated in my life, I am fine , and I mainly work as an ID specialist and scientist at the same place in Rome, the Nationa l Institute for Infectious Diseases L. Spallanzani. I am doing 2 days a week outpatients TB clinic and I run a small laboratory on TB research. However , given the pandemia, I shifted the lab activities on COVID-19, in particular on: 1. the role of coinfection (COVID-19 coinfection with tuberculosis, or COVID -19 coinfection with HIV) on the modulation of the in vitro immune specific-response to SARS-CoV-2, or M. tuberculosis or HIV in cells from COVID-19 patients at different clinical stage 

2. in vitro evaluation of the immunological and virological effect of baricinib, an anti-JAK1 and -JAK2 drugs, used in reumathoid arthritis, that has shown using BenevolentAl 's proprietary artificial intelligence-derived knowledge graph, as an agent that reduces the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis into target cells potentially inhibiting the entry. Moreover , I would be happy to contribute in any activity you may think I am useful. I wish you a happy Easter in this blessed day. Thank you for your attention and for having had the possibility of working with you that has been crucial in my personal and professional life.

Colorized scanning electron micrograph ofan apoptotic cell (green) infected with SARS-COV-2 virus particles (orange), isolated from a patient sample. Image captured at the N LAID Integrated Research Facility {lRf) in F01t Detrick . Maryland.N/A/D A panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts has developed treatment guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines, intended for healthcare providers , are based on published and preliminaiy data and the clinical expertise of the panelists, many of whom are frontline clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving pandemic. The guidelines are posted online ( covid 19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov) and will be updated often as new data are published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and other authoritative information emerges. The guidelines consider two broad categories of therapies currently in use by healthcare providers for COVID-19: antivirals , which may target the coronavirus directly, and host modifiers and immune-based therapies , which may influence the immune response to the virus or target the virus. The panel 's conclusions about treating COVJD-19 with various agents that fall into these two classes of therapies are distilled in summary recommendations. Subsequently , the document provides background information about each agent-such as clinical data about its use, ongoing clinical trials, and known interactions with other drugs-that forms the basis for the Recommendation. Tables briefly outline the same information. The guidelines also describe the evaluation and stratification of patients based on their risk of infection and severity of illness. Recommendations in this section address best practices for managing patients at different stages of infection, for example: • Outpatients who are either asymptomatic or who have mild to moderate symptoms and are self￾isolating • Inpatients with severe illness or critical disease Special considerations for pregnant women and for children who are infected are also included. A comprehensive section of the guidelines addresses a range of considerations for clinicians caring for the most c1itically ill hospitalized patients. This section includes multiple 

recommendations for patients needing critical care, including infection control procedures, hemodynamic and ventilatory support, and drug therapy. Finally, the guidelines include recommendations concerning the use of concomitant medications. These include statins; corticosteroids; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and certain drugs used to conlrnl hype rtension, known as ACE inhibitors and ARBs. The treatment guidelines panel is co-chaired by Roy M. Gulick, M.D., chief of the Infectious Disease Division at Weill Medical Hospital of Cornell University, New York City; H. Clifford Lane , M.D., clinical director of the National Institute of Allergy and lnfectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health; and Herny Masur, M.D., chief of the Critical Care Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. Members of the guidelines panel, appointed by the co￾chairs, were chosen based on their clinical experience and expertise in patient management, translationa l and clinical science , and/o r the development of treatment guidelines. They include 30 experts drawn from U.S. healthcare and academjc organizations, federal agencies, and professional societies.

Abstract Background Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern . To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Methods On 4/3 -4/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity . We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates : (i) the test manufacturer's data, (ii) a sample of 37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a combination of both. Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County was 1.5% (exact binomial 95CI 1.11-1.97%), and the population -weighted prevalence was 2.81% (95CI 2.24-3.37%). Under the three scenarios for test performance characteristics, the populat ion prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49% (95CI 1.80-3.17%) to 4.16% (2.58-5.70%). These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirme d cases. Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibod ies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.

Please verify the identity of the sender, and confirm the authenticity of all links contained within the message prior to copying and pasting the address to a Web browser. (b)(6) Thank you for your note . Shown below are my answers to your questions. hope that you find them helpful. 1. How do you recommend I reassure our staff on dealing with the stressors of COVID-19? This is indeed an unprecedented and stressful time. Stress can often come from the unknown. In times of stress it is critical to take care of one's physical health, by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. In addition , maintaining connections with fami ly and friends (via phone calls, email, or video chatting) while physically socially distancing is very important . 2. Can COVID-19 be contracted from a corpse? Infect ion control measures should be undertaken when dealing with deceased individuals with known or suspected COVID-19. The CDC provides guidance on this issue here:Caut ion￾https://www.cdc.gov /coronavirus /2019-ncov/hcp/guidancc-postmort em￾specimens.html < Caution-https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov /hep/guidance￾postmortem-speci mens.html> 3. If someone has been a user of Hydroxychloroquine for years, are they susceptible to contracting COVID-19? Clinical trials are underway to determine if hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing COVID￾19 in exposed persons. Until we know the answer to this question , persons who take hydroxychloroqu ine on a daily basis for another medical condition should consider themselves vulnerable to COVID-19 and take appropriate and recommended measures to protect themselves. 4. Are masks and gloves tru ly effective, if so, why are so many medical professiona ls contracting the virus? I believe that infection control strategies which include proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as recommended by the CDC are effective. _ Caution-https: //www.cdc.gov /coronavirus/2019-ncov /hcp/infection-control￾recommendation s.html?CDC _AA _refVal =https%3A %2F%2FCaution￾www .cdc.gov%2F coronavirus%2 F20 l 9-ncov%2f infect ion-control %2F contro l￾rccommcndations.html < Ca ution-https :/ /www.cdc.gov/coronavi rus/2019-ncov /hcp/i nf ection￾control-recommen dations. html?CDC_AA_reNal= https%3A %2 F%2 FCaution￾www.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Finfection-control%2Fcontrol￾recommendat ions.html > In cases where inadequate PPE is worn , or if is not put on/ taken off according to proper procedure, the risk of contract ing COVID is increased. In addition, healthcare workers on the front lines can be exposed if they encounter a patient who is not initially suspected of having COVID-19 without PPE, especially if they are exposed to aerosol generating processes. 

5. What is th e most important th ing we should be doing, other than social distanc ing? Social distancing is key in order to avoid coming into contact with someone with COVID-19, but washing one's hands often (or using an alchohol-based hand sanitizer) and avoiding touching one's face with unwashed hands are critical as well, especially when coming into contact with surfaces that may have been touched by others or public places. 6. Finally, what keeps you up at night, regarding COVID-19? I have said in the past that what keeps me up at night is the possibility of a pandemic respiratory infection.

Shown below are my answers to your questions . hope that you find them helpful. 1. How do you recommend I reassure our staff on dealing with the stressors of COVID-19? This is indeed an unprecedented and stressful time. Stress can often come from the unknown. In times of stress it is critical to take care of one's physical health, by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. In addition, maintaining connections with family and friends (via phone calls, email, or video chatting) while physically socially distancing is very important. 2. Can COVID-19 be contracted from a corpse? Infection control measures should be undertaken when dealing with deceased individuals with known or suspected COVID-19. The CDC provides guidance on this issue here: https :/ /www.cdc.gov / corona virus/2 0 l 9-ncov /hep/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html 3. If someone has been a user of Hydroxychloroquine for years, are they susceptible to contracting COVID-19? Clinical trials are underway to determine if hydroxychloroquine is effective in preventing COVID￾19 in exposed persons. Until we know the answer to this question, persons who take hydroxychloroqu ine on a daily basis for another medical condition should consider themselves vulnerable to COVID-19 and take appropriate and recommended measures to protect themselves. 4. Are masks and gloves tru ly effective, if so, why are so many medical professionals contracting the virus?

Fauci, M.D. Hello Dr. Fauci, 

In the current state of medical knowledge and research in the pharmaceutical industry, there is no short- or medium-term solution to prevent disease or cure patients with SARS-Cov-2 (COVID￾19). With this letter, I would like to make you aware of the preventive and curative potential of essential oils (EOs); lives could be saved. Scientific aromather apy: use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants - essential oils - for medical purposes; 'hard' science of nature, based among other things, on in-depth knowledge of organic chemistry. We are not talking about perfumery or occult sciences. According to Mr . Dominique BAUDOUX, an internationally known Belgian pharmacist and "a romatologist": there is a multitude of research on the antiviral properties of essential oils. The results are impressive and indisputable . Here are some viruses for which we have real data: ■ Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-Cov (it is a coronavirus) ■ The H1Nl flu virus ■ Avian influenza virus type H5Nl and subtypes H7N3 and H9N2 ■ The anti-infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ■ Herpes simplex virus HSV ■ Dengue virus DEN ■ Newcastle disease virus NOV ■ Jun in virus (an arena virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever) Source: https://www.pranarom.com/blog/guide-des-huiles-essentielles/les-huiles-essentielles￾efficaces-contre-lecoronavirus-vrai-ou-faux : See references 1 to 28 below . To add meat to the bone, if you visit the Nation al Cent er for Biotechnology Information (U.S.) : ■ You will find nearly 225 000 references on "essential oil." See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil ■ You will find approximately 22 000 references on "essential oil+ viral." See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=essential%20oil%20+%20viral In addition, according to a brief email exchange with Mr. Pierre FRANCHOMME, a French researcher, one of the leading experts in the field of medicinal essential oils, he informed me that : a recent Indian study (March 31) highlights the potential activity of 1,8 cineo/e (euca/yptol) on SARS-Cov-2, as I suspected from my experience on other enveloped viruses. Note: the molecule 1,8 cineole is found in high concentration in eucalyptus EOs. ■ Sharma, A.D.; Kaur, I. Eucalyptol {1,8 cineole ) from Eucalyptus Essential Oil a Potential Inhibitor of COVID 19 Corona Virus Infection by Mol ecular Docking Studies . Preprints 2020, 2020030455 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202003.0455.vl). Source : https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0455/vl 

Another study (2008) provided by Mr. Franchomme, shows a high antiviral activity of bay laurel/leaf essential oil (Lourus nobilis) on SARS-Cov, which appeared in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China and which prevailed until 2004. • Loizzo, M. R., Saab, A. M., Tundis, R., Statti , G. A., Menichini , F., Lampront i, I., ... Doerr , H. W. (2008) . Phytochemical Analysis and in vitro Antiviral Activities of the Essential Oils of Seven Lebanon Species. Chemistry & Biodivers ity, 5(3), 461-470 . doi :10.1002/cbdv.20089 0045 Source: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbdv.200890045 Since SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 {COVID-19) are close relatives, it is quite possible that Laurus nobilis essential oil will be as effective on SARS-Cov-2. Here are two other studies that should be of interest to researc hers, according to Mr. FRANCHOMME: • See reference 20 below Efficacy of cineole in patients suffering from acute bronchitis: a placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Cough 9, 25 (2013) . Source: https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-9974-9-25 Conclusions of this study : The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact. • See also refere nce 22 below. Also, according to Mr. FRANCHOMME, a clinical study on the treatment of essential oils in patients with COVID-19 has just been undertaken in a hospital setting (100 patients), double blind against placebo . I w ill know the results at the same time as everyo ne else and will inform you. Here is a summary of Mr. FRANCHOMME's analysis: The scientific commun ity is launc necl in searcno f a miradeclru g in t he basket of molecu es already known for ot her indicat ions. Our design is to trust the plant world, a great provider of remarkable mo lecules. CONCLUSION We need to think outside the box of allopath ic medicine and synthetic drugs that offer no solution and put pressure on our leaders to release funds for clinical research on the treatment of patients suffe rin g from COVID-19 using essential oils, as advocated by Mr . Franchomme . (b) (4) 

To this end, M. FRANCHOMME confirmed to me this :/ am at the disposal of your authorities to provide and explain a protocol based on essential oils. His email address is : (b)(6) In terms of a double-blind placebo clinical study, there is, as of today, a huge cohort of hospitalized patients, a significant portion of whom I suspect would be enthusiast ic about voluntary enrolment. For patients in critical care with a life-threatening prognosis, it is undoubtedly possible, given the circumstances , to bypass the usual research protocols and offer a last-resort treatment to these patients in an attempt to save their lives, with thei r permission or that of their legal representatives in case of temporary or permanent incapacity . Even if it doesn't work, I don't think patients or their loved ones will blame your government for trying everything , but if you don't, I wouldn't like to be in your shoes!

General researcher says the results point to a 'raging epidemic,' but may also indicate the city is further along the disease curve than some other municipalities ByJonathan Saltzman Globe Staff,Updated Apr il 17, 2020, 6:26 p.m. 

First responders loaded a patient into an ambulance from a nursing home whe re multiple people have contracted COID-19 in Chelsea, which has the highest concentration of COVID-19 infections in the state.Scott Eisen/Getty Nearly one third of 200 Chelsea residents who gave a drop of blood to researchers on the street this week tested positive for antibodies linked to COVID-19, a startling indication of how widespread infections have been in the densely populated city. Sixty-four residents who had a finger pricked in Bellingham Square on Tuesday and Wednesday had antibod ies that the immune system makes to fight off the coronavirus, according to Massachusetts General Hospital physicians who ran the pilot study . The 200 participants generally appeared healthy, but about half told the doctors they had had at least one symptom of COVID-19 in t he past four weeks. Public health experts already knew Chelsea hadthe state's highest rate of con fir med COVID-19 cases and that the actual rate was probably higher . At least 39 residents have died from the virus, and 712 had tested positive as of Tuesday, a rate of about 1,900 cases per 100,000 residents, or almost 2 percent . Get Talking Points in your inboxAn afternoon recap of the day's most important business news, delivered Monday through Friday. But the Mass. General researchers - who excluded anyone who had tested positive for the virus in the standard nasal swab test - found that 32 percent of participants have had COVID-19, and many didn't know it . "I think it's both good news and bad news," said Dr. John Iafrate, vice chairman of MGH's pathology department and the study's principal investigator. 11The bad news is that there's a raging epidem ic in Chelsea, and many people walking on the street don't know that they're carrying the virus and that they may be exposing uninfected individuals in their families ." "On the good-news side, it suggests that Chelsea has made its way through a good part of the epidemic," he said. "They're probably further along than other towns." Scientists suspect that people who recover from COVID-19 may be at least temporarily immune from catching it again. Several biotechs and academic laboratories, in fact, are seeking blood donations from people who have recovered, in the hopes that their antibodies can help create a treatment or vaccine. Chelsea's city manager, Thomas Ambrosino, said he learned the results of the pilot study Thursday in a conference call with the researchers. He was dismayed, but not shocked. Related: Chelsea city manager sounds urgent alarm, calls for residents to stay home 24 hours a day "We've long thought that the reported numbers are vastly under-counting what the actual infection is," said Ambrosino, w ho has called his city the epicenter of the crisis in Massachusetts. "Those reported numbers are based on positive COVID-19 tests, and we're all aware that a very, very small percentage of people in Chelsea and everywhere are getting COVID-19 tests." 

"Still," he added, "it's kind of sobering that 30 percent of a random group of 200 people that are showing no symptoms are, in fact, infected. It's all the more reason for everyone to be practicing physical distancing." Indeed, one of the doctors who tested volunteers in Bellingham Square said it's possible that some of the people who had the antibodies are still contagious. "Just because you have the antibodies doesn't mean you've cleared the virus," said Dr. Vivek Naranbhai, a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology. Researchers said the test results, which had yet to be shared with state officials late Friday, couldn't necessarily be extrapolated for the city's roughly 40,000 residents. Still, the findings provided a valuable snapshot of a community that medical experts say is especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Chelsea covers only about two square miles, across the Mystic River from Boston. For generations, it has attracted new immigrants, and about 65 percent of its residents are Latino. Many live in three-decker houses, Ambrosino said, where it's hard for people to isolate themselves. Many work in the hospitality industry and health-related fields, where exposure to the virus is greater. And a lot of them must go to work during the pandemic. To get Chelsea residents to participate in the study - which included a questionnaire that was available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese - investigators allowed them to remain anonymous. But that meant none of the participants received the results of the blood tests. The doctors used a diagnostic device made by BioMedomics, of Morrisville, N.C., to analyze drops of blood. It resembled an over-the-counter pregnancy test and generated results on the street in about 10 minutes. Although the test hasn't won the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, Iafrate, the principal investigator, said Mass. General determined it's reliable. Within days, the physicians said, they hope to set up a medical tent outside the Mass. General Chelsea Healthcare Center to perform more antibodies tests with the device. The site will be located near a tent set up weeks ago to run standard PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests for people with active coronavirus symptoms. The latter uses nasal swabs to detect whether the virus is present at the time; the antibodies blood test reveals whether someone was infected in the past. In addition to the new testing site, the researchers want to expand the study to other Massachusetts cities and towns. For all of those studies, Mass. General doctors plan to obtain the identities of participants so physicians can provide the results. But first the researchers need to come up with guidelines for what participants should do if they test positive for antibodies. Dr. Dean Xerras, medical director of the Mass. General Chelsea Healthcare Center and a co-investigator in the study, said it illustrates why it's essential for Chelsea and other communities to perform more tests, regardless of whether they detect antibodies or the virus itself. "Knowing how many people are infected is critical," said Xerras, a longtime member of the city's board of health. "We need to get them isolated. We need to get masks delivered to the city. We need to launch more safe isolation sites. We need to be able to identify cases and then give people the things they need to prevent perpetuation of the spread." Chelsea and Revere officials, with help from the state Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, secured almost 150 rooms at a Quality Inn in Revere this week for residents who are recovering from COVID-19 and unable to isolate themselves at home, according to Ambrosino. So far, only a handful of those rooms are occupied. Governor Charlie Baker on Thursday staunch ly defended the state ' s handling of the escalating outbreak in Chelsea, including asserting, without offering details, that city leaders have turned down help from his administration. 

The governor's claim surprised officials in Chelsea who told the Globe this week that the state, and even health care providers, should have recognized the virus's rapid spread through the city sooner.

(b) (5) The estimates on this page have been updated from an earlier report published in December 2018 based on more recently available information. There is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of the burden estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and publ ic health decision-makers, we use preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each season's estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available. For the revised 2017-2018 estimates, we included additional information in our estimation regarding influenza testing practices. The surveil lance system used to estimate influenza￾related hospitalizations, FluSurv-NET, collects data on patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Influenza testing is done at the request of the clinician, but not everyone is tested and influenza tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, the reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are likely underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data annually from participating FluSurv-NET sites on the amount of influenza testing and the type of test that is used at the site, and this information is used to correct for the possible underestimate of influenza-related hospitalizations . These testing data are often not available for up to two years after the end of an influenza season, and thus the estimates are revised when additional testing data become available. For the original preliminary 2017-2018 burden estimates, data on testing practices during the 2014-2015 season were used to make preliminary estimates because this season had the highest levels of testing among the prior seasons for which data were available and resulted in the most conservative (lowest) estimates of burden. More recent data from the 2016-17 season show that influenza testing has been increasing among most age groups. The current estimates were made using the highest testing rate fo r each age-group during 2010-11 to 2016-17 and has resulted in some burden estimates being lower than previously estimated. Additionally, the method we use to estimate influenza-associated deaths relies on additional data from FluSurv-NH and the National Center for Health Statistics (data on cause of deaths and numbers of deaths that occur in versus outside the hospital) that are also not available for up to two years after the end of the season being estimated . The 2017-2018 estimates are still preliminary because not all of the required data are currently available. When those data become available, these estimates will be updated again and the results may change. More answers to frequently asked questions about CDC's influenza burden estimates are available.

This plan includes priorit ized expansion of testing and building a corps of contact tracers in the US, using tried-and-true public health measures at scale. There are four essential actions to box in the virus: 1) Expand testing; 2) Isolate infected people to prevent spread; 3) Identify contacts who may have exposed; 4) Quarantine contacts. As you know, all four are crucial; if any one is lacking, the virus can escape and spread explosively again. Success requires a massive expansion of our public health capacity around the country and world. The report is attached and can be downloaded here.

Matt Pott inger Deputy National Security Advisor The Whit e House 1650 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington , DC 20502 Dear Sir, Many of us in the hyperbaric medicine community believe that there exists a simple therapy to halt the inflammatory proc ess and reverse the lung damage. This process will also simultaneously provide many time s over the amount of oxygenation offered by th e coma-inducing intubation ventilator procedure. We are reaching out to our network to make contact with the airlines to secure the use of an airplane with an onboard APU (Auxiliary Power Unit--used to pressuriz e the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID-19 pati ents and show the effectiveness of th e concept. Initial testing indicat es in one trial study 100% improvement while all others und erway, although small scale, are showing great benefit at extremely low cost and patient risk. So what is this new procedure? Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or HBOT; first used successfully in 1918 for Spanish Flu cases. HBOT is viable and appears to work well but we do not have th e number of pressure vessels / HB chambers available to treat the possibly 100,000+ who need the therap y now. Several of us in our small community have arrived at the same idea in several countrie s. The idea is no longer new or uniqu e. Again, I am proposing use an aircraft as the pressure vessel. Every airplane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all commercial airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around 9 psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their norma l airworthiness testing. Myself and others have suggested that one or mor e of th e hundr eds of grounded aircraft be provided to complete th e trial test. 737 Max are not flying but are a perfect pressure vessel for the proc edur e. Could you help us contact Boeing, the airlines or the military? No aircraft modification is required whatsoever so that is one of the issues off the table. 

The aircraft remains parked on the ground with access for ambulatory patients via a stairway. No jetway is required unless we expand this in the future for non-ambulatory patien ts. We would need to place stand ard DOT portabl e oxygen tank s in the cabin along with the associated manifold, pressure regulator, flow-meters and tubing. Each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask and breathing circuit. Ther e is no cross contamination between patients or the cabin environment atmosphere as each mask incorporates a Viral Filter Kit to help protect the technicians who are also brea thing from a sec ur e, clean so urc e. All safety issues are addressed in the plan. The same process, once proven could be utilized by our military and of course our Navy who is experiencing possible outbreaks as we speak The Patriot Clinic in Oklahoma City is my personal charity where we have provided over 15,000 free HBOT treatments for our beloved vets and 30,000+ at cost or below. We are not asking for money. Nor, am I selling anything in this effort. With th e help of a small group of supporters, ( Ralph Crafts & family ) my company is willing to provide the equipment, training and technical support to begin the process. Thank you for your ongoing service to our country, and thank you for reading and considering my propo sal. I sure would appreciate your help. Semper Fi!

(b)(6) Matt Pottinger Deputy National Security Advisor The ·white House 1650 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington , DC 20502 Sir: As one old Marine to another Ma rine, this letter contains the "straight scoop," and is intended to provide infonnation that can help stop the spread of COVID-19, and ensure the continuity of critical segments of government. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has been in use for over 100 years, and was the only effective treatment for the 1918 flu pandemic. HBOT is being used worldwide to treat a variety of serious disease s, and has been proven to be immediately effective in treating seve re COVID￾19 cases, with a success rate close to 100%. HBOT is simply breathing high-pur ity oxygen (92% or higher) for 60-90 minutes in a pressurized environment (typically between 8 and 15psi- the higher pressure is about the same pressure as doing a SCUBA dive to 33 feet). HBOT chambers can be 1-2 person sizes and portable, up to 12-seat chambe rs which are used for Navy operations. (b)(6) I have a one￾person chamber in our home , and we can attest to its effectiveness in treating severe breathing problems, like pneumonia , infections, and wounds. The currently publicized and widely accepted statement that there is no effective treatment for COVID-19 is wrong. HBO T treatments, usually just a single one-hour session, provide immediate improvements in lung function, blood-oxygen levels, and organ recovery . Unlike respirators, which do more damage than good and are basically a death sentence, HBO T provides an immediate path for recovery and healing. A team of ve1y experienced scientists and HBOT experts have developed a concept that will enable the effective treatment of large numbers of people by using some of the thousands of grounded commercial aircraft as large HBOT chambers. I'm an old Marine Corps jet pilot , and we use our (b) (6) so I have the professional contacts to confirm and verify the efficacy of the concept. 

Every airplane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around 9psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their normal airworthiness testing. We have equipment staged and ready to go now, to treat 25 COVID-19 patients ata time- we need an airplane, and we can be treating people and saving lives in about 36 hours. The aircraft we need remain parked on the ground, no modifications are needed-we will simply place portable oxygen tanks in the cabin with the associated tubing, manifold, and pressure regulators, and each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask. There is no cross contamination between patients, because everyone is breathing oxygen from their own persona l mask. We are reaching out to our contacts in the airlines to ask for the use of an airplane and APU (Auxiliary Power Unit- used to pressurize the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID-19 patients and show the effectiveness of the concept. We could do the same thing with a single military transport aircraft (many of which have been configured for medical use). As a Marine, and with my knowledge of HBOT, the recent death of the Theodore Roosevelt sailor is particularly upsetting, knowing that a couple of Senior Chiefs or Marine Master Sergeants could have configured an aircraft in Guam in a couple of hours and be treating all the sailors from the carrier. We are not asking for money- my wife and I are paying for all the required equipment and support personnel. HBOT chambers are easily implemented and supported- you could have one in your office ( ours is 8' long and 34" in diameter when pressurized) and it would only take a couple of hours to train your corpsmen to operate it. I don' t know of a better guarantee of continuity in the current pandemic. Please note that (b)(6) I have no financial or political interests in the HBOT treatment concept, companies, or manufacturers-we receive no benefits/rewards, other than helping to save many lives. You will receive a letter from Ed Betts- he's a good man, really knows his stuff, and I trust him with my life- please take what he says seriously. 

Thank you for your ongoing service to our country , and thank you for reading and consid ering the information in this letter. Semper Fi ! Respectf ully, Ralph E. Crafts Marsha ll, Virg inia (b)(6)

No viral shedding? No infectivity. The concept is that EVERYONE should take these items. Two of the items also positively affect heme binding. Covid-19 binds to heme causing 02 desaturation, lung failure and death. First a short bio: Dr. Josh Backon was affiliated with the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine for over 33 years. He has a good track record (84+ publications quoted by over 750 other researchers www.google.com /scholar?start=O&g=%22backon ++j. %22&hl=en&as sdt=0,5 and in over 250-300 texts as per https://www.google.com /search?tbo=p&tbm =bks&q =%22backon+j .+%22&num= 100 ). In the 1980's he was Consulting Editor of the Journal of Pedi atric Endocrinology, Editor of Reviews in Pure and Applied Pharmacological Sciences, and Associate Editor of the International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health. From 1990- 2004, he was a consultant on emergency planning and management at Israel 's National Police Headquarters with Nitzav Mishneh Dann y Fisher. Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, is now being used to treat Covid-19.

Fauci, M.D. Director, NIAID Dear Dr. Fauci: As a fellow graduate of Regis High Schoo l (b)(6) and very active alumnu s, I am writing to you out of deep concern for our nation. I am reading reports in The NY Times that President Trump may be considering firing you for tell ing the truth about the negative consequences of delays in mobilizing the Amer ican response to the coronavirus threat. The Times had run articles in recent days detailing the pertinent facts that place the blame 

for this delay squarely on President Trump. We can reasonably infer that significant loss of life and financial harm resulted from this delay. The mission of Regis was to mold young men with leadersh ip potential to be "men for others" in the Jesuit tradition. To achieve that goal Regis also sought to hone our intellectual talents and imbue us with Christian morality to succeed throughout our lives in a persistent pursuit of excellence, which embodies the truth. A mission to relentlessly pursue and proclaim the truth. The fact that you have consistently and courageously pursued that mission during one of the darkest times in our history explains the extraordinary admiration in which you are held by millions of Americans. You have won their confidence , which has enabled so many to make exquisite sacrifices to win this crucial battle. People will follow heroes, which is precisely how the vast majority views you. I am writing because I want you to know how important you are to America. We cannot lose you and we can not lose the value of truth. Truth must prevail or our precious democracy is in grave peril. Consequently, and I know I speak for the vast majority of Americans whose decency is beyond question, if Donald Trump seeks your removal, please resist for the sake of our nation. An appeal to the populace will not go unanswered. Religious leaders will flock to your defense, as will the media and leading political leaders, including Biden and Cuomo. Republicans can not afford to alienate what you stand for. Jeopardizing the Catholic vote would be suicide. In closing, know how proud all Regians are of you. You will always be an inspiration to those who understand the value of service to others. Our prayers are with you. David G. O'Brien (b)(6) Attorney at Law (b)(6)

Item 1: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research (NEW) Activity Type: Strategic Plan Summary: A new strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on - and accelerate - new and existing research efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVID-19, as well as understand the underlying causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Plan prioritizes research to improve fundamental knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 vir us and COVID-19 disease, develop diagnostics and assays, characterize and test therapeutics, as well as develop safe and effective vaccines targeted to ward decreasing disease incidence, mitigating morbidity, and preventio n mortality from this disease. 

Impact on COVID-19 Pandem ic Response: The strategic plan outlines a research plan targeted at prevent ion and mitigation of COVID-19 disease.

Researchers tested the decontamination of small sections of N95 fi lter fabric that had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Decontamination methods tested included vaporized hydrogen peroxide {VHP), 70-degree Celsius dry heat, ultraviolet light, and 70'/o ethanol spray. All four methods eliminated detectable viable virus from the N95 fabric test samples. The results will be posted on a preprint server (timing TBD). The findings are not yet peer-reviewed but are being shared to assist the public health response to COVID-19. Impact on COVID-19 Pandem ic Response: Study shows that respirators could be used multip le times {2-3 times depend ing on decontamination method) ICO: NIAID NIH Point-of- Contact: Vincent Munster, Ph.D., and Marshall Bloom, M.D., from NIAID's Laboratory of Virology are available to comment on this study .

Accelerating basic research is key to ASM's mission - it is where cure and prevention begin. It is impressive how rapidly research on SARS-CoV-2 /COV ID-19 has advanced in just a few weeks , but easily accessing new and relevant research has been a challenge for basic researchers . When ASM's Council on Microbial Sciences held a COVI D-19 summit to ident ify the most significant scientific work on the virus , the coronavirus researc hers and clinical microbiologists raised the need for the scientific commun ity to curate important COVID-19 research . ASM is excited to announ ce the launch of the COVID-19 Research Registry , a platform curated and vetted by experts in the field of virology and related discipline s to provide immediate access to top COVID-1 9 research . I am proud that Lynn Enquist, Ph.D ., Henry L. Hillman Professor in Molecular Biology , Princeton University and fo rmer ASM President , will serve as Chief Curator for this Registry. Dr. Harold Varm us, Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine has agreed to join us as Chief Consultant on the project. We are honored to have the following as Assistant Cura tors-in-Chief : • Rozanne M. Sandri-Goldin, Ph.D., Chancellor's Professor , Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, University of California , Irvine and Editor-in-Chief of ASM's Journal of Virology • Vaughn Cooper , Ph.D ., Professor , Microbiology & Molecular Genet ics , University of Pittsburgh , and current ASM Board member The entire curatorial board is listed on the Registry site . 

ASM is proud to add this initiative to our ongoing efforts . Through its capillary network of clinical microbiologists around the country and the world, ASM has accelerated communica tion and cleared roadblocks to ramp up SARS-CoV-2 testing. We continue to work closely with our dedicated colleagues , the indefatigable clinical microbiologists manning the front lines in hospitals and testing labs during this unprecede nted global emergency. We send our thanks - and admirat ion--to these ASM members who are contributing directly to saving lives in this perilous time. Our COVID-19 resource page provides important ASM updates and current information on the coronavirus. We are also working with the news media to provide authoritative ASM experts and reliable material on the microbiology of viral epidemics. ASM journals is also providing free access to more than 50 research articles published over the last year in our 16 scholarly journals and expediting review for submitted papers related to coronavirus, ensuring that new research is quickly made available to the scientific community . We are hoping that researchers will find the COVID-19 Research Registry a useful resource . We look forward to your comments , questions or suggestions , since your input will be critical for improving this platform and making it usef ul for the scientific community. All feedback can be sent to covid 19reqistry@asmusa.org . We are all in this together. Sincerely , Stefano Bertuzzi Chief Executive Officer, ASM Stefano Bertuzzi, Ph.D., M.P.H.

To: Mollet, Me lissa {NBCUniversal, WRC) Subject: [EXTERNAL] Therapy for COVID-19; Results of Trial in Italy Melissa, I wanted to expand a bit on the COVID-19 therapy I mentioned and provide some information about the man who is developing it . Hoping that you can get this into the right hands, as it seems like a very promising lead in this fight . The therapy, invented by Professor Claudio De Simone, has shown extremely encouraging results in a preliminary trial at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University "La Sapienza" in Rome, Italy . Professor De Simone convinced the doctors there to start a trial on patients affected by COVID-19. Considering the excellent results obtained, the number of patients enrolled is increasing day after day. Our firm became aware of these results directly from Professor De Simone, who has been a client of our managing partner, Jeremy Schulman, since 2015. The formulation employed in these patients at the La Sapienza Infectious Diseases Clinic is manufactured in France and known as "SIVOMIXX." The product is a specialized blend of eight different freeze-dried bacteria with considerable ant iviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Patients admitted to the clinic at La Sapienza, presenting as positive for COVID-19 and with the typical symptoms of the disease, are being treated by oral bacteriotherapy utilizing SIVOMIXX. In each case, SIVOMIXX administration was followed by a dramatic improvement in their conditions. The key takeaways are that use of SIVOMIXX correlated with fewer deaths (zero in the treated group), fewer patients transferred to the ICU, and a dramatically reduced risk of patient intubations . The sponsors of the trial using SIVOMIXX are now beginning to enroll patients with severe cases who have been admitted to the ICU. Attached to this email is a confidential dossier about the SIVOMIXX product and a summary of the ongoing study. Upon request, I am also able to send you an Excel file containing the raw data from the study, so NIH can review them, with the understanding that this should be treated as "highly confidential." Since the clinical tria l is continuing in Italy, we expect to have results covering additional patients on a rolling basis. The researchers conducting the study intend to publish their results in the coming weeks. However, considering the pandemic and the lack of effective treatment options, we want to make NIH aware of Professor De Simone's therapy without any delay. SIVOMIXX is a relatively new formulation developed by Professor De Simone, currently in limited commercial production at a manufacturing facility in France. Professor De Simone has sufficient supply available to utilize with 100-150 COVID-19 patients immediately. Professor De Simone could, on his own, arrange a small-scale supply to use with hundreds of additional patients in the United States. He is willing to provide his current inventory of the product to the United States government. He expects that the Trump administration could quickly confirm the efficacy of SIVOMIXX to significantly improve symptoms of COVID-19 and reduce the duration of patient hospital stays. After that , Professor De Simone is willing to collaborate with the administration to bring a large-scale production of SIVOMIXX for use throughout the United States, Italy (where he was born), and Switzerland (where he lives). Professor De Simone already has ongoing partnerships with a 

number of manufacturing companies, including one in the United States, for the production of another one of his produc ts (Visbiome, referenced below). With appropr iate guidance and instruction from the Trump administration, we believe the U.S. manufacturing companies could re-tool to produce SIVOMIXX on a large scale within several weeks . Professor De Simone (more information about him below) and Jere my will do whatever it takes to bring this critical therapy to as many Americans as possible on an urgent basis. Jeremy can be reached at anytime on his cell phone - (b)(6) Thanks so much for passing this on. Best, Jake About Professor De Simone. Professor De Simone is a world-renowned expert in gastroenterology and the inventor of several highly successful probiotic medical foods. Until 2010, he was an Associate Professor for the Infectious Diseases Group at the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the University of L'Aquila, Italy. Subsequently, he was appointed Head of the Infectious Disease Department and Director of the AIDS Coordinat ion Group of the Abruzzi region, Italy. He is currently a retired Professor of Internal Medicine, still collaborating with the University, and a Fellow of the American Gastroenterology Association. Professor De Simone's research specialt ies have been in the fields of immuno -pathogenesis of infectious diseases. He has published the results of his research activities in over 200 scientific articles, reviews, case reports, and book chapt ers. Professor De Simone is both a researcher and a medical practitioner. He tests his laboratory hypotheses in the university hospital clinic on patients w ith serious diseases. He was responsible for controlling the AIDS pandemic in Italy's Abruzzi region in the 1990's. Products developed according to Professor De Simone's know-how have shown positive results in patients with serious diseases. One of his signature formulations , known as the "De Simone Formulation," is now sold in the United States as "Vi sbiome ." The De Simone Formulation has been the subject of more than 70 published human clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy in managing severe gastrointestinal symptoms from such diseases as ulcerative colit is, pouchitis, and liver diseases. Concerning pouchitis, the De Simone Formulation is recognized by the world's professional gastroenterology societies as a "standard of care," an achievement that no other probiotic substance previously has attained. The De Simone Formulation became the "gold standard" in its therapeu tic class. Its role in patient care has been endorsed in the guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association ("AGA"), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization ("ECCO"), and the British Society of Gastroenterology, as well as in the New England Journal of Medicine .

I recall with great pleasure all our previous meetings, espec ially the last one in 2017 , when 1, together with my team members , had an opportunity to visit you at NIH. We are grateful to you and your team for the most important contribution to establishing US-Georgia biomedical collaboration that significantly increased our country's research and practical capacities. Your personal role in combat ing HIV and other emerging epidemics such as SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, canno t be overestimated. I am confident that your leading role in this fight against COVID-19 will be crucial for defeating the pandemic not only in the United States, but around the globe. We close ly follow your briefings and interviews on COVID-19 (including recent very interesting convers ation with Dr. Howard Bauchner at JAMA) and as always your views are very apt and to the point. We fully agree that the approaches you suggest are the most effective way to defeat the pandemic. Most importantly your recomme ndations are applicable not only to the United States, but to other countries as well and we eagerly take them into considerati on while planning our strategies here in my country of Georgia . I would like to use this opportunity to update you on COVID-19 situation in my home countty of Georgia : The country quickly responded to this threat fu st by stopping flights with China in January, followed by more strict measures after the first case was diagnosed on February 26. These measures included national lockdown , active contact tracing, isolation and quarantine . The Government of Georgia appointed me to lead the National Committee on the clin ical management 

of COVID-19. Our effort to contain the spread of the virus had been effective so far with 296 cases of COVID-19 and 3 lethal cases reported up to now. We are impatiently awaiting results of vaccine and therapeutic trials supported by NIAJD, which I am confident will help to defeat this pandemic disease . On our side, Georgia is committed to make its modest but important contribution to the global efforts.

I wanted to let you know that Peter Kilmarx has been calling for the formation of a "U.S. COVID-19 Response Corps" since March 21 (unrelated to NIH work). FEMA could hire thousands of tempo rary workers quickly with existing authorities and funding. CDC could provide training and technical assistance. The workforce would be deployed to and managed by state and local health departments at their request. There's a lot of enthusiasm for this from Jeff Duchin in Seattle, to Tom Frieden, CSIS, ASTHO, and 40 mem bers of Congress (bicameral, bipartisa n) who sent a letter to FEMA asking them to do this. The 7,000+ recently evacuated Peace Corps volunteers could be one recruiting source. Anoth er approach is for CDC to fund state and local authorities for those who are able to hire at this speed and scale. There's more information in the string below.

Mark McClellan responded to my email yesterday: "I'd suggest adding outreach to mayors and county execs if that hasn't happened yet. They are really on the front lines for this next phase." 7. I understand legislation is in the works, but don't have details. 8. No news from FEMA or indicat ion to my knowledge that they are planning a substantial ramping up of staffing. 9. A key limitation on the impact of contact tracing will be the relative importance of asymptomatic spread. 

10. A note on serology: The current U.S. cumulative incidence is 0.169%. The specificity of FDA EUA Cellex test is 95.6%. Not accounting for undiagnosed cases, Positive Predictive Value is only 3.5%.

Some updates: (b) (6)j > 1. ASTHO sent the attached memo to Congress today RE: Contact Tracing Workforce calling for "flexible long term and emergency supplemental funding to expand the .. . contact tracing workforce" at state, local, and related levels. It recommends against using FEMA for hiring. ASTHO notes tha t currently there are only 2,200 DIS nationw ide while JHU estimates that 100,000 contact tracing employees are needed to address COVID-19 in the immediate future. The memo mainly calls for 1) $3.6 B emergency funding through the CDC Crisis Cooperative Agreement to eligible jurisdictions, plus 2) a $4.5 B annual Public Health Infrastructure Fund. 2. Resolve to Save Lives (Tom Frieden) is advocating for CDC to have the needed authority and political support to provide tra ining, systems, and technical expertise, while the CDC Foundation and ASTHO provide staffing through direct assistance to health departments . 3. CDC could support curriculum development and training through the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers https://nnptc .org/ and/or TB Centers of Excellence https://www.cdc.gov/tb/ education/tb coe/defau lt .htm 

My take: We share the goal of rapid ly and substantially ramping up the public health workforce and should emphasize that message. It would be very challenging for any of these potential approaches to reach 100,000 in the short term. I don't have any special allegiance to FEMA, but their traditional role in emergency response is quickly hiring many thousands of workers. They are hiring now, but not at this speed and scale. CDC and FEMA should have an MOU through which FEMA can hire staff and detail to CDC, but they don't seem to be pursuing. One model could be FEMA detailing staff to state and local authorities to manage the hiring process. FEMA is proud of their ability to get people from "door to desk" in one week . This would not be "federalizing" contact tracing or other public health activities. In all cases, the invitations and the oversight wou ld come from the state and local authorities, who are best able to decide what mechan ism(s) work for them. Lastly, this concept includes more than contact tr acing. Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN) in her podcast Wednesday noted that the state 211 call line has gone from 2,000 to 25,000-35,000 calls per day. So this concept would still have a role even if not direct public health functions .

This NEJM articl e is main ly about heath care workers, but does mention ot her roles in social support. Important development : CDC's Bob Redfield is calling for a publ ic health army for contact tracing after this acute phase: https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-very-aggressive￾contact-tracing -needed-for -u-s-to-return-to -normal It turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working on a plan to allow the U.S. to safely begin to scale back those policies. CDC Director Robert Redfield spoke with NPR on Thursday, saying that the plan relies on not only ramped -up testing but "very aggressive" contact tracing of those who do test positive for the corona virus, and a maj or scale-up of personnel to do the necessary work. 

I'm not sure CDC has the authority, capacity, or politica l support to hire an army at this time. This is a tradit ional FEMA role. CDC can prov ide train ing and technical assistance.

Good conversations w ith Marcus @ASTHO and others today. Important to emphasize that state and local authorities have the lead. This would not be "federaliz ing" the response. It would be making federal employees available by request to integ rate in state- and local-led activities. Some will welcome the extra hands. Some will prefer to have funding to do their own hiring. Paying salaries of state employees at risk for furlough to work on COVID-19 will make a lot of sense, but won't be enough. Need a menu of options . 5. Many concepts and plans for public health and social response are being circulated. All of them will need an expanded workforce. Outreach: 6. I'm in touch with someone in Adam Boehler's office .

At the same time, the agency has been forced to halt a major hiring initiative, and has closed training facilities to avoid spreading the infection. The number of available personnel who are qualified to lead field operations has fallen to 19 from 44 in less than six weeks, and staff members have been pulled from responding to other disasters, but training centers in Maryland and Alabama have been shuttered until mid-May . In addition, an effort to recruit new employees called "Harness" is on hold, according to a senior administration official with direct knowledge of FEMA's operations . ...

IL has ongoing need for large workforce. Much easier to get staff from feds. Slower to hire at state level. MA implementing 1,000-person contact tracing effort. • John in touch with Pelosi's office, Delaura, Conf of Mayors, League of Cities. • Other potential champions -AST HO, APHA, Josh Scharfstein @JHSPH • General agreement that for bipartisan emergency approval should emphasize near-term (e.g., 2 year) impe ratives of COVID-19 and economic emergencies, not a new permanent wor k force. • General agreement that Peace Corps is the low-hanging frui t, but not all 7,000 RPCVs would do this and the need is much greate r. • CSIS OpEd with Ami Bera (D-CA) and Susan Brooks (R-IN) coming out in Politico or CSIS website by Monday Other updates: • Telcon Friday with Brooks staffer. They are putting together legislation, ideally bipartisan w ith Bera. Now fully briefed on CRC concept and potential implementation model. Clarified not duplicative of USPHS Ready Reserve Corps which is now authorized but not being implemented (to my knowledge) and would be different profile, i.e., USPHS has physicians, nurses, engineers, etc. • Telcon Saturday with CDC COVID-19 Chief Medical Officer . Confirms many are thinking about the workforce issue. Notes that CDC unlikely to "own," but great suggestion to engage CDC￾funded National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers for training. https://nnptc.org/ with eight centers around the country. CRC concept may be brought to national response discussions with FEMA in Washington DC. • FEMA contacts report they are hiring RPCVs, but do not report majo r speed up or scale up. FEMA recruiting email attached. • Charles shared Vanessa Kerry OpEd emphasizing same themes : response workforce and jobs: https ://www. boston hera Id. com/2020/04/01/ massach u setts-genera I-hos pita 1-i nfectio us￾d isease-tea m-ca I ls-on-state-to-harness-people-power/ Next steps: • Executive - support/impetus to FEMA to increase speed and scale • Legislation - new appropriations for FEMA or CDC if needed • National advocacy- media, opinion leaders • Demand signal - state and local authorities requests • Implementation and management details working out Over all goal: Greatly increase COVID-19 response workforce to control disease and provide jobs. A COVID-19 Response Corps would be a (big) part of solution. RPCV ideal first cadre for CRC.

Workers would take on work like tracing the contacts of diagnosed individuals, monitoring the health of those in quarant ine and staffing call centers. An agency such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or AmeriCorps could potentially manage the group, says Blumhorst, who has been advocating for the project. Salaries could come from funding that's already been allotted to the COV/0-19 response but hasn't yet been spent. The NPCA has discussed the idea with the offices of several members of Congress that are receptive and support ive, Blumhorst says, and they're planning to speak with more congresspeople and federal agencies and also hope to draw public atten tion to this potent ial project.

The latest (March 26) 2-page concept note attached. Updates: l. Steve is working on getting the Op Ed out in press and/or on CSIS website by Tuesday. We'll let you know. 2. Glenn and Charles have found very good receptivity on the Hill. 3. I've had a couple very good calls with FEMA folks at senior levels (extensive RPCV network) . They are already reaching out to RPCV and are well funded. They can get an RPCV on board in a week. They have a few different hiring mechanisms that would be appropr iate. The scale and speed need to be ramped up substantially. 4. I've reached out to contacts at nationa l mayors and governors associations with no reply. Also no reply from CDC (Jernigan and Schuchat). Next steps - when OpEd comes out, amplify multiple levels to publicize and create demand . The need for this is great. The feasibility looks very good . Please share your suggestions .

This is very helpful. I've updated the concept note - att ached. Now a two-pager. Added training and prevention bullet . Decreased the numbers and budget based on feed back to date . Draft OpEd fort hcoming . Grateful if others can advocate as they are able (and others of us are not). Glenn - please add anything on your meetings on the hill yesterday, the FEMA call, or advocacy plans. My takeaway is that a FEMA disaster corps or FEMA-Americorps Corps is feasible. More input: • Call yesterday with Glenn and former FEMA staff : George Haddow and Miche al Coen o FEMA Corps is a partnership of FEMA and Americorps with about 1,200-1,800 members . Part of Americorps. FEMA pays 100%. Mainly younger, lower-skilled supervised work. o FEMA reservist disaster corps has 3,000-4,000 members . Mostly shorter-term deployments as temp employees. Many retired military. Can be activated with State of Emergency declarat ions. o FEMA currently has sent 3-4 liaisons to each state. Disaster corps not activated. o Onboarding 5,000 would be a big lift. Peace Corps has seconded staff to other agencies in past, so this could be an option . o Only private sector partner for FEMA is Red Cross. Not recommended for this. • Jen Kates (KFF) and her colleague Josh Michaud - "th ink it is a great idea" • Tom Frieden -"It's a good idea." o Robynn Leidig, Manager, Strateg ic Initiat ives, Resolve To Save Lives - "Compelling idea and worth exploring" • Concern about risk to RPCVs, training and oversight needed • Lack of PPE, best to focus on tasks that don't need PPE • Resentment of current staff worried about threat to their jobs • Fairness: should open to others - Amer icorps, VISTA, CDC PHAP, CSTE fellows, USAID Global Health Fellows • Manageme nt absorptive capacity limited at CDC. Consider ASTHO/ NACCHO or PHI.

Please let me know any critical additions or corrections to these notes . • Jeff Duchin (Seattle) noted multiple possible roles in contact tracing, mitigation with homeless and incarcerated, adverse consequences of social distancing, infection control support, alternat ive care site coordinat ion, lab specimen collection and transport . He shared concerns about infection prevention and thei r PPE shortage. CDC had 40 people deployed, but they departed . Longer deployments (e.g., >90 days) needed to validate onboarding and training effort . He will follow up with more detail on potential roles and numbers. • Angela Dunn (Utah) agreed wit h roles in contact tracing , also staffing a call center, rural out reach and specimen collection. She said Utah was not a current priority for FEMA and CDC was conducting a transmission study. She shared Jeff's concern about the onboarding effort . • Cindy Burnett (Utah) mentioned the need for social support in rural settings. • Craig Conover (Illinois) added that for them the long-term care centers and homeless populations were priority concerns. It would be feasible and helpful to have staff able to collect specimen swabs. • Charles Holmes (Georgetown) made an analogy to community health workers in Zambia and how much can be accomplished and enhanced with tablet-based approaches, work￾flow apps, and video instructions. • Steve Morrison (CSIS) emphasized the importance of finding an organizationa l home, mentioning potential challenges for both CDC and FEMA. He noted timing of response packages being considered, the hunger for creative ideas, and urgency for this to be brought forward. He noted potential champions, listed with others below. He thinks the Peace Corps connectio n is a compelling factor. • Glen Blumhorst (NPCA) expressed his support and insights on potential champions, e.g., three RPCV in the house. He is going to Capitol Hill tomorrow . • Jody Olsen (Peace Corps) (prior to the call) expressed interest and noted that Peace Corps has no authority to operate in the United States. (The possibility of an Executive Order 

detail ing returned volunteers from Peace Corps to state and local aut horities was mentioned by others on the call.) She also noted that Barbara Stewart, Director of CNCS (AmeriCorps and VISTA) has been inviting RPCVs to jo in. Next steps: 1.

I trust your experience , professionality and above all your wisdom in these weeks. While I am a mechanical engineer and I run my food company fro living, I have been interested and passionate to the global fight to the Coronavirus. SUGGESTION: Could it be possible that peop le die of pulmonary micro thrombosis rather than respiratory issues? If this is the case, this is more a cardiovascular issue than a respiratory, and ventilation or intubation do not count as much as, instead, to give patients some drugs to prevent the thrombosis , such as ANTI-INFIAMMATORIES. If you ventilate a lung where blood doesn't get there, may be it's useless! In fact 9 out of 10 die . If the problem were cardiovascula r and not respiratory, then it could be a venous microthrombosis and not pneumonia that determines fata lity. And why are thrombi formed? Because there is an inflammation that induces th rombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanisms. I know this thesis is right the contrary of some recomm endations that several doctors all over the world (in China first) had made so far: no ibuprofene, no anthibiotics etc etc. But I believe that some researches on the cardiovascular problem induced by inflammation would be worth doing it. An apology for my English. Thank you for your attention, Stay healthy! Kindest regards Nicola Nicola Pizzoli President & CEO

I am concerned about the recent fight between the US and WHO because it may adversely impact the current global efforts in controlling the spread of COVID-19. As we all know, US has been leading WHO's efforts for decades and essentially WHO's role is mostly coordinating responses in low- and middle - income countries with support from the US and other high income countries. Frankly I was looking for leadership from the US CDC rather than WHO when I was doing (b)(6) . Until COVID-19 is controlled in all countries, the infection could come back to hit us in this country again. Therefore it is now the worst time to undermine WHO's global coordinating capabilities. What I learned from my former colleagues and friends in (b)(6) where I attended medical school and obtained my MSc in epidemiology might offer some explanation for the differe nces in COVID-19 statistics in US vs. China. Please find attached a couple of articles published by my former colleague,Cb~ ___ , of which the 1st attachment is a more updated version . (6) • First, the maximum lockdown in Wuhan that started on January 23 and also in the rest of the entire Hubei province of 59 million people during the subsequent 2-3 days, coupled with maximum efforts in early identification, immediate isolation of identified infected individuals and close monitoring of contacts, did work and had to work according to epidemiological principles. China did it by invoking level 1 public health response that was historically reserved for smallpox, plague or cholera, which essentially enabled the entire country to be completely locked down for several weeks. Many vi llages and townships set up checkpoints to refuse 

anyone to come in or go out; a driver from Hubei had to stay on an inter-provincial highway for 20 days surviving by begging instant noodles from people policing exits; all front doors of residents in a township in Hubei were sealed by local government officials and volunteers to prevent them from getting out of their houses. • Second, there must be under-reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths because the public health and hospital systems in Wuhan and a few other hardest hit municipalities were overwhelmed for one to two weeks; conceivably many infected individuals were not getting a chance for testing and some of them must have died without being identified as COVID-19. I'd say that this kind of under-reporting is unavoidable, especially in the epicenter of a new pandemic. Actually I suspect that such under-reporting could have happened in this country as well although perhaps to a lesser degree. • Third, there could be a third category of casualties, that is, patients who were suffering from chronic diseases but couldn't get necessary treatments because hospitals were overwhelmed. I read a sad story in social media in which a patient who needed frequent dialysis comm itted suicide by jump ing out of his window. It is highly likely that many such patients died during the lockdown even though I couldn't confirm the specific case or find any statistics. There could be many other collateral damages including socio-psychological effects . Combined, the effect of the maximum lockdown, the under-report ing of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths as well as collateral deaths of other causes that were associated with the lockdown could be several times of the reported statistics from China. Here I'd not say that China purposely under￾reported COVID-19 cases or deaths but rather, China pursued an extreme approach and achieved an extreme result, including severe collateral damages. Of note, Dr. LI Wenliang (the whistleb lower) voiced concern on 12/30/2019 and was criticized for having not followed the legally proper reporting process but nevertheless the WHO China Office was informed on 12/31/2019 of a pneumonia of unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen ). We in the US and many other countries pursued different approaches, which are more humane but less effective in terms of blocking transmissions. This is the reality, which needs to be commun icated with and recognized by the public; to make the humane approaches work as effectively as possible, we need everyone's support and cooperation, which cannot be achieved by blaming China or WHO. The public has to understand that we are in a pandemic, which means that tens of millions are supposed to be infected and millions are supposed to die from it, unless we take necessary actions to block the transmission and to take good care of the infected. Finally, I'd like to say a few words for public health colleagues in China. In my personal view, to be fair, they have done their best to inform the global public health community of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China by briefing WHO and many count ries as soon as they identified COVID-19 (12/31/2019 - 1/3/2020) ; they shared the genetic sequence of the virus on 1/ 12/2020; and the numbe r of scientific and medical publications in English shortly afterwards was unprecedented . I did a brief search and identified the following: A Novel Coronavirus from Pat ients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (1/24/2020) https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017 A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to -person transmission : a study of a family cluster (1/24/2020) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/artic1e/pii/S0140673620301549?via%3Dihub

Hub • Home • Hub's List of Medical Fun Facts Vol. 230 April 1, 2020 Biden Picks His Running Mate Press Conference 

For mer Vice President Joe Biden April 1, 2020 (Official Transc ript) BIDEN : Good morning everyone. I am glad to see all you reporters sitting 6 feet from each other . I know it is burdensome, but we must work together to defeat this awful Zika . . . Rebola ... the flu . . . er, what?, ... I mean, you know, the Coroner virus . Speaking of the current virus crisis . . . boy that has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? ... it almost rhymes . .. I would like to announce my pick of a running mate; Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of NIH since 1984 .. . almost twenty .. . er . . . many years ago . Now before I start to answer your quest ions, let me give you some reasons for my choice . Number 1: Dr. Fauci is smarter than I am, but I am ta ller and younger than he is. Number 2: He is very experienced. He has worked with many President ial administrat ions since he came to Washington ... in the 1980's as I remember . He told Ronald Reagan about the AIDS epidemic, advised two Bushs . . . one of them gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom ... by the way, Ben Carson got his medal during that same ceremony, . . . where was I? Oh, yeh . . .two Clintons .. . yes two, remember Hilary's Health Care Plan? . .. and, of course, Obama or two. Number 3: He gives very good TV interviews , even on Fox News with Sean Hannity trying to mislead the viewers. 

Number 4: His medical training has given him that special skill that all physicians must have to succeed - "Always sound right, and if you don't know an answer, make one up." But he is like one of my famous namesakes on Dragnet . . . Sergeant Joe Friday . .. "Just the facts, Ma'am." Now I'll take your questions. [Sounds of shouting , general loud babbling , a baby crying , a chair falls over] REPORTER : " Mr. Biden have you moved away from your promise to pick a female running mate?" BIDEN : Did I say that? When was that? ... Oh, it was during one of those debates? ... I wouldn't call it a promise. It was a statement from which I am now socially distancing myself, and that makes it a very timely question. . .. This social distancing is for the pits. I haven't smelled a good head of hair in weeks ... for the record, my test was negative ... and I will ensure that women's voices will be heard in my administration by appointing several to my cabinet. Elizabeth Warren naturally will be Secretary of the Treasury. Kamala Harris as an experienced prosecutor would be an excellent head of the Department of Justice . .. I think she is Latino too, isn't she? ... I am not sure about Senator Amy Kolbuchuck from Minnesota and she has great hair, but Marianne Williamson, ... remember, the physic healer ... could serve as Chief of the Alternate Universe . . . excuse me, Alternate Therapies within HHS. Adding Senator Gillibrand to the cabinet would weigh the group too heavily towards New York, since Dr. Fauci is from Brooklyn. I will, of course, appoint Tulsi Gabbard as Ambassador to America Samoa. REPORTER : "Do you have any concerns about any regrettable incidents in Dr. Fauci's past?" BIDEN : Not really. My staff has vetted him very thoroughly. The only whiff of scandal we found was his medical school yearbook picture where he was being lifted by two of his taller classmates so as to appear as even taller than they. None of them were in black face. Also some people may have difficulty knowing how to pronounce his name correctly. It is pronounced as "Fow-ch i" with the soft "c" sound common to 

many Italian names, . . . and as the Senator from Nevada I wish to say that I have many Italian￾American friends who are hard-work ing, decent citizens, but I must excuse myself from this Corleone hearing for another important committee meeting ... oh, sorry ... was I channeling the Godfather again? ... a great movie. There is another small concern, since he is from New York City and his name ends in a vowel people may think he is associated with Rudy Giuliani .... but we know that he is taller than Mike. We have completely debunked the New Yorker Magazine stories that Dr. Fauci has recommended internal alcohol to kill the coronavirus since external alcohol really doesn't work. In fact, he only recommended it as an antidote to the daily briefings of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Fauci also noted that internal alcohol effects may be briefer than the briefings, so viewers may repeat a dose PRN (as necessary). REPORTER : " Is it true that as noted in your background Press Release just handed out that Dr. Fauci was born on Christmas Eve, and are you concerned about any back lash from Trump supporters who regard Trump as the Second Coming." BIDEN: Dr. Fauci is an American . Even though he was born in Brooklyn, there is no question about his citizenship eligibility for this office. I think that a resurgence of the Birther Movement which was so viscously directed at my close friend and mentor, Barrack Obama, . . . there I final ly got his name out there ... would be very unfortunate. Next question. REPORTER : "Has Dr. Fauci made any significant contributions in fields other than virology and infectious diseases." BIDEN : Well let me tell you a down-to-earth, fascinating story of one of his most significant contributions. It will be a short one, I promise. Since the Coroner virus pandemic has taken over all the headlines, editorial pages, social media memes, political cartoons, TV shows, graphic artist shops, and a lot of other things swamping articles about the Opioid Deaths epidemic, Dr. Fauci has developed a new attention -getting graphic to replace the familiar 1-10 faces of pain levels; the 1-4 faces of Pandemic Panic levels. 

1 2 4 REPORTER: "But face 4 is the same as face 2. Isn't that a confusing message ." BIDEN : Exactly "Thank you Mr. Biden, and Happy April Fools Day.

Why can't the CDC make a public service announcement that everyone should be wear ing some kind of mask @ in public? It doesn't have to be N95 or even surgical though that wou ld be ideal (as is done in every Asian country) given that the virus is actually aerosolized (several studies confirm this ) and that it can be spread by asymptomatic carriers (which account for possibly more than half of the positive cases - we will never know) it seems obvious that food markets are no different from hospitals and in many cases worse since at least in hospitals people are wearing some protective equipment ... just say wear a cotton mask, a scarf, a bandanna , a DIV paper towel mask .. whatever- but no one should be going to a market without one and absolutely no one working in a store or stocking supplies or delivering food, packages, mail etc should be allowed to work without something covering the face- th is includes pharmacists as well, obviously D wtf ls wrong with this country?

I am so proud of your effort s during the se remarkable tim es in history . Thank you! !! I cherish those 5 years {1995- 2000) that I served as Director of NIDR (that became NIDCR) wh en we were able to co-sponsor effort s to uti lize saliva as an informative fluid for HIV detect ion . For me that was an invaluable opportunity to be part of 

Harold Varmus' leadership team and to continue my research within NIAMS. I was inspired by your public comments a few nights ago on CNN regarding your observations of significant variance in the pathogenesis or phenotypes noted for subsets of critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ventilators in ICU. I was immediately reminded of David Feinberg (CEO of UCLA Health Sciences, more recently 5 years at Geisingers, and currently CEO of Google Health Companies) who used genotyping for populations around Lancaster PA and discovered about 3-4% with undiagnosed genetic diseases that translated into reduced costs of hospitalization, treatments, etc. Kaiser-Permanente Northern California, and many other systems, have also used this approach since sequencing has become cost effective . Perhaps a select sample of people who require ICU, and another that require ventilator, might inform the genotype of the most susceptible people and might also inform a target to use to discover what existing drug or therapy could be mobilized. Through your position, might there already be a large data set of whole genome sequences (e.g. military) that could be rapidly explored using bioinformatics? As you may recall, my personal research activities have focused on craniofacial diseases and disorders. For example, Osteogenesis Imperfects (0.1.) presents cardiopulmonary disorders in addition to bone and 

tooth disorders. Since penetrance varies, cases of rare cond itions can illuminate "hidden" SNP abnormalities in key gene clusters (e.g. MHC gene clusters, etc.). Considering lung disorders as you mentioned in your comments about pathogenesis, already known gene mutations that present several major phenotypes including pulmonary diseases could become very useful. Perhaps Francis and others at the NIH could create a trans-NIH approach that is enabled to visit this pandemic from the perspective of human phenotype variance discovered via genomics? I asked Martha Somerman to explore the talents available at NIDCR (and beyond) related to connective tissue genetic diseases that associate with Types 1 and 111 collagens, elastics, and hyaluronic acid glycoproteins AND lung tissue fibrosis, etc . She may also reach out to you. Meanwhile, thank you for your untiring efforts to use science to inform health policy. Of course, let me know if I can be of any use to you . Always, Hal

I receive over 1000 e-mails per day and even with staff screening, I do not see them for days. There is still an issue/prob lem with serologic tests in that they need to be va lidated as being sensitive and specific. Many tests that have been used t hus far are not accurate and ARE M ISLEADING. The UK bought millions of these from China and found that they were inadequate. The FDA is in the process of validating certain tests this week and if they pass, then we can expect to have tests w ithin the next few weeks to do the things that you have suggested. Best regards, Tony From: Nader, Ralph (b)(6) Sent : Wednesday, April 1, 2020 9:35 AM ------~~ To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E] (b)( > -------- Subject: COVID-19 Question Dear Dr Fauci, I hope this email finds you wel l. Thank you for everyth ing you are doing for our country in these difficult times. I realize your time is extremely valuable - especially during these times. I have one question - if you can help me answering it. Why are serologic tests not made abundantly available during these times? This will help in so many ways: - Can it be used to triage healthcare workers? Naturally "vaccinated" healthcare workers may be better triaged to be on the front lines fo r example, taking care of COVID-19 patients. {In times of limited PPE, documentation of natural immunity is probably one of the best PPE's out there) 

-Another major use for it: People can be asked to remain home, until they have documentation of natural immunization . Serologic tests are very cheap, can be mailed, and done at home. Immunized individuals can carry the test as "proof" of immunity - and may be able to go back to work etc. It is just a thought. It may be a very candid question that I am asking. But while we are waiting for a vaccine (and this will take several months), some people may be able to benefit from a very cheap test (that can be done at home) to short-circuit that waiting time. Thank you for everything you are doing to our country, You are such an inpiration to us all. I wish you all the best. Thank you.

We would require very little of your precious time right now, perhaps one or two very brief video-l ink phone interviews over the next few months, just as you have appeared on Trevor Noah's The Daily Show and spoken with basketball star Steph Curry. Later this year, after the current crisis has subsided, we would find time in your busy schedule for a proper sit-down in which you could tell us the stories that speak to the key moments in your remarkable career. I am excited to work with Lia Carney and Topspin Productions on this project, because it has been important to me to expand the roster of AMERICAN MASTERS films to include scient ists. Over its 33 year history , our series has profiled artists such as Leonard Bernstein, Maya Angelou and Raul Julia, athletes including Billie Jean King and Ted Williams, and now we are presenting the stories of James Watson and Oliver Sacks in our pantheon of great films. Our series is dedicated to telling biographies with the utmost care, and for that reason we have been honored with awards like the Emmy, the Peabody, the Grammy and even an Oscar. We would be honored to have you join us in our public television effort to educate Americans about the domestic and global health issues that have been the focus of your career.

I'm writing to request a chance to embed with a team doing a coronavirus serosurvey, to tell a public health story from the front lines as I believe I'm uniquely positioned to do. I've made a similar request to the CDC, but the nationwide reach of the NIAID serosurvey might make my proposal easier to consider, so I'm coming hat in hand to you as well. Twenty years ago, as a temporary CDC employee during a four-month Knight Journalism fellowship , I had the opportun ity to take the EIS course in Atlanta and then work on several CDC outbreak and disease invest igations . One was a serosurvey on Long Island after West Nile virus had recently emerged in the U.S. I headed one of a dozen CDC teams that included a driver, a phlebotomist and a health aide from the New York state and Suffolk County health departments. We went door-to-door to consent part icipants, get blood samples and do interviews on exposure and symptoms. I appreciate the tremendous scientific value that serosurveys offer and the kind of attention to detai l and study rigor that's needed to get reliable information. I'm also a longtime medical journalist who understands and is sensitive to confidential ity , ethical and privacy concerns. I've been recognized by my peers as a science writing leader . https :lj casw. org/ casw / a rti cle/m a ri lyn n-m arch ione-associated-press-wi ns-victor-coh n-prize I've attached some letters from CDC and othe r health officials regard ing my work on the serosurvey, a photo of the EIS and CDC team (that's me toward the right in the front row) and t he MMWR report resulting from our work . The field supervisor -- Dr. Anthony Marfin, now with the global vaccine group PATH ( (b)(6) is willing to speak to you on my behalf. Dr. Richard Besser, now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundat ion, was my fellowship superviso r and mentor at CDC. Others I worked with include Dr. Anne Schuchat, Dr. John Ward, Dr. Robert Tauxe and Dr. Lyle Petersen . And of course, you know me from nearly three decades of medical writ ing, includ ing the HIV/AIDS government trip to Africa when Tommy Thompson was healt hy secretary. The Associated Press reaches half of the world 's population every day. I hope to offer a story that I and the AP are uniquely able to provide , to show and explain how public health is done and how science is accompl ished during a pandemic .

Thank you both for your service to the nation and for doing your jobs with conviction and commitment in doing the right thing - sticking to science and not yielding to politics .

The unique challenges that this pandemic has created have also created opportunities , and we here at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have proudly participated with our federal, state and local partners during this COVID-19 pandemic as well as over the last 16 years, having matured an extensive program in the research, education, and clinical components of highly infectious diseases and biocontainment. The UNMC Center for Global Health Security has been the umbrella organization that has organized all of these components and continues to have strong leadership from retired military public health as well as gifted research scientists from across the nation. As a co-founding partner of NETEC, as a recipient of the Regional Disaster Health Service Awards, and as a close collaborator with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State, we have enjoyed the opportunity to always "lean in" as the need arises. 

I am sure your days are full not only of the complex logistics and tension that fill leadership roles at this time but also maintaining a "steady hand on the rudder" as we navigate these challenging waters. I think back to my days at New York Presbyterian and Cornell Med, knowing that we are both Cornell Med grads, both did our residency and fellowship training in New York, and have had the opportunity to interact back so many years ago. I do remember quite well the first time that we met and have always reflected warmly at having even a brief opportunity to interact. I do not write to ask for anything but to just simply thank you for all that you continue to do and know that you always have a friend here in Nebraska. I wish you and your family the very best as we continue this journey. Most sincerely, (b)(6) Jeffrey P. Gold, M.D. Chancellor (b)(6) Administrative Associate I Chancellor Jeffrey P.

Participants in my observational, longitudinal, epidemiologic Baltimore -based study, HANDLS https://handls.nih.gov/ are terrified by the level of disease they are seeing in their communit ies across Baltimore. We have been on the phone with and texting participants to educate them , support them in their efforts to get tested, remind them of the importance of social distancing and self-isolation when appropriate to protect their health . We are acutely aware of the ir fragility. Testing in Baltimore is limited. The National Guard has set up community test ing at the Pimlico Race Track; however , although we have deployed our mobile medical research vehicles to Pimlico in the past to conduct our study, the current crime rate is such that our partic ipants and community residents in general do not go to the Pimlico area especially if they are on foot. The other issue with testing for African Americans and our participants is the need to have a health care provide r that one can contract to discuss symptoms to get a referral for testing. The unravelling of t he Affordable Care Act has severely impacted access for African Americans across the nation and especially in Baltimore . Our participants are calling my staff clinician and nur se practitioner for referrals if they have symptoms. We have reached out to colleagues at 

Health Care for the Homeless, JHU and other medical entities to facilitate access. Thank you all you are doing. Since I work in Baltimore, I haven't seen (b)(6) . The current pandemic however, reminds me of the days of the AIDS epidemic when I worked as Sam Broder's special assistant for underserved populations wh ile Peggy Hamburg worked for you .

Nat Geo, Disney, and Bob Iger himse lf, all understand the need for discretion now but are wildly supportive about relea sing a film that will celebrat e the importance of your life, science and public hea lth. I wanted the best home, broadest distribution , and strongest team for your film. You have entrusted me with your sto1y, so I ju st want to do right by it. We are really happy with the filming that we have done so far personal (b)(6) home, school) to work ( office etc). 3) The other film we have been working on (ENDING AIDS), which follows globa lly the HVTN trials/latest Aids research to comp lete " the toolbox" is definitely still happening. It is now in pause with COVID-19 .... but will move forward again when we get through this. Filming at research sites in South Africa, US, and Latin America has been great...and when you have time - in the future- I will outline . You obviously are a key subjec t in ENDING AIDS also , but ENDING AIDS will spend a lot of time with doctors at the field research sites and with volunt eers in the trials. The Aids conference and meetings footage we have shot with you wi ll be shared between films, smart ly and distinctly. ENDING AIDS will be released a year plus later than the release of your biographical film- I am focuse d on your film now. Howard Hughes Medical Institute remai ns the educational pa1iner on ENDING AIDS. In the fall we will fina lize the broadcast/streaming partner for ENDING AIDS. So, bottom line it will be released a year after your film , and will be a film focused on showing in detail where we are now with aids research and the key people in the chain from you 10 a young female voluntee r in South Africa/a young male volunteer in Binningham. FILMING REQUESTS for your film now. 4) NO more ask ing to film with the Task Force. 5) I do have two persona l filming requests for you - would it be possible to drive to NIH with you once or twice a week and capture your working/ap propriat e conversat ions in the car. That will be so helpful narratively to tracking you r scientific and communic ation leadership. The footage we did that first day is truly 

great. We will just tum around and come back after the ride there--- in our follow car (we have NIH access badges). Second ly, would it be possible to sit down with you on camera for J 5 minutes once a week ( on the weekend?) at the office or on the back deck/some safe location to talk with me in real time about what you are managing with treatments , vaccines , etc. so we can pull the scientific /conunw1-icatio11 nanative on COVID-19 through your film. 6) We love the live truck and the walks, so whenever that works we will be there. 7) l NEVER ever want to interfere with the work on the Task Force, lives are at stake. IF something doesn't work for filming no questions asked we don' t do it, we stop, cancel/pivot. No need to explain, the team here understands and only wants to do what works for you, your team ... , (b)( '1 . With appreciation , Janet

As Otolaryngologi sts, we are currently and expect to continue to be dramatically impacted by the current pandemic, given that our care for patients rout inely includes upper airway endoscopy (30-40 scope proc edures a day is routine) which as you know is a high-risk aerosolizing procedure. As I'm sure you are aware, Otolaryngolgists have been amongst the hardest hit clinicians in terms of patient-to￾provider transmission of COVID-19. Your input for 10-l 5 minutes would be an honor.

wo ampuls of remdesivir are pictured during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, April 8, 2020, as the spread of coronavirus disease (covid-19) continues. Ulrich Perrey/Pool via REUTERS (Pool/Reuters) By Christopher Rowland April 10, 2020 at 5:25 p.m. EDT A majority of a small group of patients showed improve ments after being treated with an experimental coronavirus treatment made by Gilead Sciences, bolstering hopes for finding a treatment for the disease, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday. The group of patients received the anti -viral drug remdesivir as part of a "compassionate use" tria l, not a doub le-blind placebo-control led tria l which wou ld offer more definitive evidence. Also, the cohort of patients was small, only 53 patients in the United States and around the world . Those limiting factors prevent scientists from declaring that the drug works . Still, the improvements offered positive news about a drug seen by global health authorities as offering the best shot at becoming a treatment for the disease. Thirty six patients out of 53 - or two-thirds - showed improvement in oxygen support, trial authors said. Seventeen of 30 patients who were on ventilators were able to be taken off the life-support machines. "We cannot draw definitive conclusions from these data, but the observations from this group of hospitalized patients who received remdesivir are hopeful," said Jonathan D. Grein, MD, Director of Hospital Epidemiology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, and lead author of the journal article. "We look forward to the results of controlled clinical trials to potentially validate these findings ." While 68 percent of the patients showed improvement in the level of oxygen support they needed, 13 percent died, the NEJM study said. That 13 percent compares favorab ly to mortality rates of 17 to 78 percent in China among severely ill patients, the authors wrote . 

Gilead's stock has been bolstered for weeks by expectat ions over remdesivir . Remdesivir was discovered by Gilead in the hunt for antiviral drugs about a decade ago, and the Nationa l Institutes of Health has partnered with the company to explore its benefits. It was shown to work against an array of viruses in laboratory tests. It showed effectiveness in primates infected with Ebola but failed in a trial in the Democratic Republican of Congo in humans with the deadly disease. It has shown effectiveness as a preventive therapy in primates for MERS, which is a coronavirus cousin of the Covid-19 virus. There are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus, but the FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two decades-old anti-malarial drugs. There is scant evidence that the therapy works, but President Trump has repeatedly boosted the promise of the drugs. Even while multiple full clinical trials of remdesivir continue, Gilead hasbeen swamped with requests for "compassionate use" of the drug . Under compassionate use rules, physicians can obtain experimental drugs for their seriously ill patients when there is nothing else to try. Gilead said last week that it had enough of the experimental drug on hand to treat up to 140,000 people under compassionate use programs. 0 Comments Christopher Rowland Chris Rowland joined The Washington Post business team in 2018 after serving as the Washington bureau chief for the Boston Globe, leading coverage of two presidential elections and overseeing political enterprise reporting .

By Michael Specter April 10, 2020 

., I .. "You stay completely apolitical and non-ideological," Fauci says. "I' m a scientist and J 'm a physic ian. And that's it. " Illustration by Tyler Comrie. Photograph by Win McNamee I Getty Just before 1nidnight on March 22nd, the President of the United States prepared to tweet. Millions of Americans , in the hope of safeguarding their health and fighting the rapidly escalating spread of COVID-19 , had already begun to follow the sober recommendation of Anthony S. Fauci, the country 's leading expert on infectious disease. Fauci had warned Americans to "hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing." Donald Trump disagreed. "WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF," he tweeted . Trump had seen enough of "social distancing. " In an election year, he was watching the stock market collapse , unemployment spike, and the national mood devolve into collective anxiety. "I would love to have the country opened up, and just rarin' to go by Easter," he said, on Fox News. "You 'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it'll be a beautiful time." Trump 's Easter forecast came more than two months after the first U.S. case of COVID-19 was identified , in Washington State, and more than a hundred days after the novel coronavirus emerged , first from bats and then from a live-animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Every day, more people were falling sick and dying. Despite a catastrophic lack of 

testing capacity , it was clear that the virus had reached every comer of the nation. With the Easter holiday just a few weeks away , there was not a single public-health official in the United States who appeared to share the President 's rosy surmises. Anthony Fauci certainly did not. At seventy-nine, Fauci has run the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for thirty-six years , through six Administrations and a long procession of viral epidemics: H.I.V. , SARS, avian influenza , swine flu, Zika, and Ebola ainong them. As a member of the Administration's coronavirus task force, Fauci seemed to believe that the government's actions could be directed , even if the President's pronouncements could not. At White House briefings , it has regu larly fallen to Fauci to gently amend Trump's absurdities , half-truths, and outright lies. No, there is no evidence that the malaria drug hydro xychloroquine will provide a "miracle" treattnent to stave off the infection . No, there won't be a vaccine for at least a year. When the President insisted for many weeks on denying the government's inability to deliver test kits for the virus, Fauci, testifying before Congress , put the matter bluntly. "That 's a failing," he said. "Let's admit it." When Trump was not dismissing the severity of the crisis, he was blaming others for it: the Chinese , the Europeans, and, as always, Barack Obama. He blamed governors who were desperate for federal help and had been reduced to fighting one another for lifesaving venti lators. In one briefing, Governor Andrew Cuomo , of New York , said, "It's like being on eBay with fifty other states, bidding on a ventilator." Trump even accused hospital workers in New York City of pilfering surgical masks and other vital protecti ve equipment that they needed to stay alive. "Are they going out the back door?" Trump wondered aloud. As a reporter who writes mainly on science and public-health issues, I've known Fauci since the H.I.V ./ AIDS epidemic exploded , in the rnid￾eighties. He once explained to me that he has developed a method for dealing with political leaders in times of crisis: "I go to my favorite book of philosophy , 'The Godfather ,' and say, 'It's nothing personal, it's strictly business.' " He continued, "You just have a job to do. Even when somebody's acting ridiculous , you can't chide them for it. You 've 

got to deal with them. Because if you don't deal with them, then you're out of the picture." Since his days of advising Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Fauci has maintained a simple credo: "You stay completely apolitical and non-ideological, and you stick to what it is that you do. I'm a scientist and I'm a physician. And that's it." He learned the value of candor early. "Some wise person who used to be in the White House, in the Nixon Administration, told me a very interesting dictum to live by," he told me in 2016, during a public conversation we had at the fifty-year reunion of his medical-school class. "He said, 'When you go into the White House, you should be prepared that that is the last ti1ne you will ever go in. Because if you go in saying, I'm going to tell somebody something they want to hear, then you've shot yourself in the foot.' Now everybody knows I'm going to tell them exactly what's the truth." Americans have come to rely on Fauci's authoritative presence. Perhaps not since the Vietnam era, when Walter Cronkite, the avuncular anchor of the "CBS Evening News," was routinely described as the most trusted man in America, has the country depended so completely on one person to deliver a daily dose of plain talk. In one national poll, released last Thursday, seventy-eight per cent of participants approved of Fauci's performance. Only seven per cent disapproved. On March 23rd, Fauci failed to appear at the daily briefing in the White House pressroom. Twitter promptly lost its mind. #NoFauci became a top trending topic, followed closely by #whereisFauci and #letTonyspeak. There was speculation that Trump, who is inclined to fire anyone who disagrees with him or, worse, garners some praise in the media, had lost patience with Fauci . As one of Fauci's old friends told me, "This is a President who doesn 't give a shit about Fauci's accomplishments, his history, or his learning. If anything, they're negatives." The truth was less alarming. "I was tied up in a task-force meeting , and we were trying to work out some difficult policies," Fauci said. "I have no trouble with the President. When I talk to him, he listens." My experience with Fauci suggested that this last statement was perhaps a triu1nph of pragmatism over accuracy. His priority, as he's made clear, is 

to do what is necessary to save lives. So I was not surprised to receive an e-mail from Fauci the following day, saying that he had been asked to refrain from participating in personal profiles. It seemed that it was one thing for him to talk about the news with reporters or even to chat on Instagram with Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star. But focussing on himself, rather than on the President, was another thing entirely. Fauci and Trump are about as odd a duo as American political life has ever produced . Both men are in their seventies. Both come from the outer boroughs of New York City. Both are direct, even blunt. But that's where the resemblance ends. Fauci has always been a person of unusual discipline. Nearing eighty, he works about eighteen hours a day. Long ago, when his three children were young , he and his wife , Christine Grady, who runs the bioethics department at the National Institutes of Health, decided to maintain the sanctity of family dinners by starting them when he got home from the office, at around nine o'clock. For decades, Fauci has taken long lunchtime runs, but, during the crisis, he 's cut back his routine to power walking- and only on weekends. Fauci parses his words with care and believes, above all, in the power of facts and the efficacy of data. ADVERTISEMENT David Baltimore , a Nobel laureate and a pioneer of molecular biolog y, told me, "Tony is unique , in that he has such credibility with politicians that he's been able to insert hard facts into the conversation. That has been wonderful for our country and the world." According to David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University who for years has advised the government on biological threats, "Tony has essentially become the embodiment of the biomedical and public -health research enterprise in the United States. Nobody is a more tireless champion of the truth and the facts. I am not entirely sure what we would do without him." Fauci can be impatient with the compromises of politics. In my conversations with him, he has responded furiously when a dicey amendment, a bogus rider, or a "poison pill" is attached to a public-

health bill. He recalled one congressional provision, in 2016 , that tried to make it "legally permissible to fly the Confederate flag at national cemeteries. I am not kidding. " When dealing with politician s, he told me, he relies on the pseudo-Latin expression Illegitimi non carborundum: Don't let the bastards grind you down. But he has inspired respect throughout the political world and beyond. Fauci 's office walls are covered with scores of photographs of him with Presidents , senators , visiting Prime Ministers , business leaders, actors. In October, 1988, George H. W. Bush , during a Presidential debate with Michael Dukakis , was asked who his heroes were. "I think of Dr. Fauci ," Bush replied. "You 'v e probably never heard of him .... He's a very fine researcher , a top doctor at the National Institutes of Health , working hard, doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. " These days, nearly everyone has heard of Fauc i. Pandemic-memorab ilia entrepreneurs have put his face on bottle openers , coffee mugs, and bumper stickers: "In Dr. Fauci we trust. " The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum has produced a seven-inch likeness of him, partly to raise money to produce protecti ve gear for medical workers. There's a Facebook group called Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen, and another called Dr. Fauci Memes for Social Distance Teens. A petition has circulated to nominate him as People' s "sexiest man alive." On right-wing social media and talk radio, Fauci has a different image: he is routinely disparaged as a closet lefty who is exaggerating the threat of the corona virus. "Has anyone else noticed that every suggestion by Dr. Doom Fauci just happens to also be the worst possible thing for the economy?" the conservati ve Internet TV host Bill Mitchell tweeted . "That's not an accident folks." An analysis in the Times found more than seventy Twitter accounts that have pushed the hashtag #FauciFraud , with some tweeting out anti-Fauci bile hundreds of times a day. "There see1ns to be a concerted effort on the part of Tru1np supporters to spread misinformation about the virus, " Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has studied misinformation , told the paper. "There is this sense that experts are untrustworthy , and have agendas that aren 't aligned with the people." Fauci has received so many personal threats that the Justice Department recently appro ved a security 

detail for him. Fauci shrugged it off, telling reporters, "I've chosen this life." The crisis that the world now faces comes as no surprise to Fauci. On January 10, 2017, ten days before Trump took the oath of office, Fauci delivered the keynote address at a conference at Georgetown University , titled "Pandemic Preparedness for the Next Administration. " After describing his years of managing epidemics, he posed a series of questions to the audience: "Will there be a resurgence of Zika? We're getting into the summer in South America. Are we going to see a resurgence or not? What about influenza? Are we going to get a new pandemic?" Fauci's last point, he emphasi zed, was almost certainly the most important: the possibility that some unknown , powerfully infectious pathogen could emerge to threaten the world. "What about things that we 're not even thinking about?" he said. He let the question drift out over the hall. "What is for sure," he concluded , "is that, no matter what, history has told us definitively that it will happen." On the day that Anthony Stephen Fauci was born , the front-page headline in the Times was "PRESIDENT TO GIVE EMERGENCY FACTS TO NATION ON RADIO." It was Christmas Eve, 1940. The Second World War had begun, and the United States was less than a year away from joining the fight. Fauci grew up in southwest Brooklyn , first in Bensonhurst and later in Dyker Heights, where his family ran a pharmacy and lived in an apartment upstairs. The pharmacy was across the street from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. When Mass was finished on Sundays, Fauci recalled, people would walk over to get prescriptions filled and to buy whatever else they needed for the coming week. Tony's father, Stephen, dispensed medications , and was known to customers as Doc. His mother, Eugenia , worked the register, along with his older sister, Denise. From an early age, Tony spent evenings and weekends riding around the neighborhood on his Schwinn, making deliveries. 

Fauci's parents were born in New York; one set of grandparents had emigrated from Naples, the other from Sicily. Anthony first took Communion at the age of seven and was confirmed at twelve. He went to elementary school at Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Bensonhurst. "I had no idea at the time when I was there, being taught by the Dominican nuns, that I would be interested in science," he said. "I was interested in a lot of things, mostly sports, but certainly not science." In those days, baseball was the social glue of Brooklyn. The borough was Dodger territory and Ebbets Field was consecrated ground- but Fauci was devoted to the Yankees, who played in the faraway Bronx. In the midst of the coronavirus crisis, I e-mailed to ask about this anomaly, not necessarily expecting an answer. He replied almost instantly. "You probably are unaware, but half the kids in Brooklyn were Yankee fans," he wrote. "We spent our days arguing who was better: Duke Snider versus Mickey Mantle ; Roy Campanella versus Yogi Berra ; Pee Wee Reese versus Phil Rizzuto and on and on. Those were the days, my friend." Fauci has often referred to his father as "laid-back," which , if true, must be a characteristic that skips a generation. "Tony has always been driven," Michael Osterholm , the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and a longtime friend of Fauci's, told me. "Whatever he was doing, he had to do it better than anybody else. I don't know if it was certainty or something else. But he was meant to lead. Always. Everyone who knew him knew that. And Tony knew it, too." In 1954, he began attending Regis, a private Jesuit high school on the Upper East Side. Rigorous, small, competitive, and tuition-free, Regis is considered one of the finest all-male schools in the country. Fauci thrived there, though the commute between Dyker Heights and Eighty￾fourth and Madison was long. He once estimated that he had spent the equivalent of seventy days of his teen-age life on the various subways and buses he took to get to and from school. Fauci revelled in the demanding coursework. "We took four years of Greek, four years of Latin, three years of French, ancient history , theology," he recalled. He developed an ability to set out an argument 

and to bolster it with evidence- good preparation, it turned out, for testifying before Congress. Last year, at a dinner that Regis held in his honor, he said that the school had taught him "to communicate scientific principles, or principles of basic and clinical research, without getting very profuse and off on tangents." At the time, though, Fauci had no interest in becoming a doctor. "I was captain of the Regis High School basketball team," he once told me. "I thought this was what I wanted to do with myself. But, being a realist, I very quickly found out that a five-seven, really fast, good-shooting point guard will never be as good as a really fast, good-shooting seven-footer. I decided to change the direction of 1ny career." At school, Fauci 's accomplished peers were headed to careers in medicine, engineering, and the law. At home, he was steeped in the humanities: "Virtually all my relatives on my mother's side-her father, her brother, and her sister's children-are artists." His mother helped tip the balance. "She never really pressured me in any way, but I think I subtly picked up the vibrations that she wanted very much for me to be a physician," Fauci said. "There was this tension-would it be humanities and classics, or would it be science? As I analyzed that, it seemed to me that being a physician was the perfect melding of both of those aspirations.'' From Regis, Fauci went on to another Jesuit institution , Holy Cross, in Worcester, Massachusetts. His high-school faculty had left him little choice in the matter. "They just wouldn't write a recommendation for you if you wanted to apply to Harvard or to Cornell, or Columbia," he said. Fauci enrolled in 1958 and was pleased to find that the university took a broad view of premedical studies. He signed up for a program called Bachelor of Arts- Greek Classics- Premed. "It was really kind of bizarre," he recalled. "We did a lot of classics, Greek, Latin, Romance languages .... We took many credits of philosophy, everything from epistemology to philosophical psychology, logic, etc. But we took enough biology and physics and science to get you into medical school." During the summers, Fauci worked construction jobs. One year, he found himself assigned to a crew that was building a new library at 

Cornell Medical College, on the Upper East Side. "On lunch break, when the crew were eating their hero sandwiches and making catcalls to nurses, I snuck into the auditorium to take a peek," Fauci recalled in 1998, at the medical school 's centennial celebration. "I got goosebumps as I entered, looked around the empty room, and imagined what it would be like to attend this extraordinary institution. After a few minutes at the doorway, a guard came and politely told me to leave, since my dirty boots were soiling the floor. I looked at him and said proudly that I would be attending this institution a year from now. He laughed and said, 'Right , kid, and next year I am going to be Police Commissioner. ' " Fauci graduated first in his class from Cornell in 1966, just as America's involvement in Vietnam was accelerating. Every new physician was required to perform some kind of military service. "We were gathered in the auditorium at Cornell, early in our fourth year of medical school," Fauci recalled. "Unlike today, we had only two women in the class and seventy-nine men. The recruiter from the armed forces came there and said, 'Believe it or not, when you graduate from medical school at the end of the year, except for the two women, everyone in this room is going to be either in the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, or the Public Health Service. So you're going to have to make your choice. Sign up and give your preferences.' " Fauci wanted to work in the U.S. Public Health Service; his fallback was the Navy. He got his first choice, and ended up at the National Institutes of Health , which was then establishing itself as the country's primary center for biomedical research. Nearly everyone in academic medicine spent some time at one of its branches; except for three years back at Cornell to complete his internship and residency, Fauci has spent five decades there. In 1972, Fauci started as a senior researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He was drawn to investigating ailments that were difficult but not impossible to treat. "I wanted something that could make you very sick and kill you unless I intervened. And if I 

intervene, you're essentially cured," he told Ushma Neill, the editor of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, in 2014. "Now, that seems a little bit too simplistic, but that's really the nature of most infectious diseases." Working in the lab of Sheldon Wolff, Fauci studied the molecular nature of fever. The field of immunology was still young, but scientists were rapidly learning how to manipulate the smallest components of individual cells, which opened the way to a decade of discovery. Chronic fevers can have a number of underlying causes, among them an uncommon condition known as vasculitis- an inflammation of the blood cells that often occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own blood vessels. Many of Fauci's vasculitis patients suffered from rare inflammatory diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis , which damages blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. The disease was almost always fatal. Fauci and his infectious-disease colleagues at the N.I.H. were frequently asked to visit the National Cancer Institute, which was in the same building as his lab, to consult on patients who were receiving chemotherapy. The drugs suppressed tumors, but they were highly toxic. And they had another side effect, Fauci told me: "Those people are susceptible to a lot of things like infections and bleeding, because the treatment has destroyed their immune systems." 

In 1990, Fauci was the government's leading researcher foc ussed on the AIDS epidemic. Photograph by George Tames/ The New York Times/ Redux Fauci, together with Wolff, his mentor, wondered if this side effect could be harnessed to help vasculitis patients, whose immune systems were overactive. "I thought if we could somehow give a cancer drug at a low enough dose perhaps we could tum the disease off without any of the secondary complications ," he recalled recently. "First we did it in a few patients, and, much to our delight, they had a total remission. Before you know it, we ended up curing a very, very lethal, albeit uncommon, disease." For the first time, this technique enabled researchers to do effective work on lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection. "If you look at innnunology, it has fro1n the very beginning been inextricably linked to infectious diseases," Fauci said. "What is the immune system for? The immune system protects you against invaders from without￾microorganisms - as well as, in some cases, the emergence of certain tumors from within." In 1981, a strange new syndrome emerged that transformed Fauci's research and, eventually, the lives of millions of people around the 

world. "All of a sudden, this new disease comes along," Fauci recalled , referring to what would soon come to be known as AIDS. "Even before the cause of it was proven to be H.I.V., everybody in the field knew that it had to be a virus. I said to myself, 'Here it is, a virus, still to be determined, that's affecting profoundly and destroying the human immune system. ' "Fauci believed that he had been training all his life for a threat like this one. He was an expert in viruses and in the immune system-and he had always been attracted to combatting serious, even fatal diseases. "I wanted to be where the action was," he said. At first, few public-health officials seemed to care. In June of 1981, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , a publication of the Centers for Disease Control , issued a paper that included an account of five young men, all gay, who had contracted pneumocystis, a form of pneumonia that had previously been reported only in people with dramatically impaired immune systems. The young men described in the study had all been healthy. "I thought it was a fluke," Fauci recalled. "I put it aside on my desk, thinking that maybe this was some drug that they had taken that suppressed their immune system." A month later, an even more alarming report arrived from the C.D.C. Fauci read it with an uneasy sense that a disaster was looming: "I made the decision that I was going to stop what I was doing , much to the chagrin of my mentors, who were saying, 'Why do you want to give up a great trajectory of a career to study a handful of gay men with this strange disease?' But, deep down, I really knew that this was going to explode. " Fauci wrote a paper to sound the alarm. "I called it my apologia pro vita sua- an explanation for what I'm doing," he said. In the paper , Fauci pointed out that, although the disease "seems to selectively affect a particular segment of our society," it demanded a medical solution. Moreover, he warned, "any assumption that the syndrome will re1nain restricted to a particular segment of our society is truly an assumption without a scientific basis." Fauci sent the manuscript to The New England Journal of Medicine, in late 1981. It was rejected. "One of the reviewers said I was being alarmist," Fauci said. He tried a different 

journal , The Annals of Internal Medicin e, and the following June the paper was published. In the laboratory , Fauci began making progress. He had been investigating B cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies. In 1983-before H.I.V. was even known by that name-his lab became the first to report that B cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS. When a healthy person is invaded by a virus, antibodies mount a defense, but, when H.I.V. hijacked B cells, the antibody system went awry. Fauci and his team had identified one of the crucial features of AIDS. "We made that observation without having any idea of what we were dealing with," he said in an interview for an N.I.H. oral history. "I think that speaks for sound scientific and clinical observation." The politics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage. On October 11, 1988, more than a thousand AIDS activists gathered outside the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration , in Rockville, Maryland, to protest the agency's glacial reaction to the epidemic. The activists knew that their community needed new treatments if they were to avoid catastrophe - but they were stymied by the F.D.A.'s drug-approval process, a remarkably inflexible system that typically took years. That same day, another group of protesters marched onto the campus of the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda , Maryland. They were headed for Building 31, the home of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute's director in 1984, was now the government's leading scientist focussed on the AIDS epidemic. Even though he was not running the F .D .A., he appeared almost daily in the media to discuss the crisis. "My face was the face of the federal govermnent ," Fauci told me. He was asked the same question nearly every day: why wasn't the government moving faster ? It didn't help that the Reagan Administration seemed so indifferent to the plague. Fauci watched from his office window as activists surrounded the building and tried to scale its walls. Some were dressed in black robes 

and carried scythes. Many waved pink-and-black banners, bearing the words "NIH Wake Up!" or "Stop Killing Us!" All over campus, a chant could be heard: "Fuck you, Fauci!" "God, I hated him," Larry Kramer, the writer and activist who helped establish the two most important AIDS advocacy groups in the country, the Gay Men's Health Crisis and ACT UP , said. "As far as I was concerned, he was the central focus of evil in the world." Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media. He called him an "inco1npetent idiot" and a "'pill-pushing" tool of the medical establishment, insulted his wife, and even compared him to Adolf Eichmann. In 1988, Kramer published a scathing open letter. "Anthony Fauci, you are a murderer," he wrote. "Your refusal to hear the screams of AIDS activists early in the crisis resulted in the deaths of thousands of Queers. " As the epidemic spread and the death toll rose, it was common for gay activists to view Fauci and NIAID with rage. Fauci did not control the drug-approval process, but he was seen as a barrier to opening access to clinical trials, in which volunteers could receive potentially lifesaving medications. For most people infected with H.I.V., taking experimental drugs was the only alternative to simply waiting for death. Yet the F .D .A.' s arcane rules prevented the vast majority of patients from qualifying for trials. For instance, a significant number of H.I.V. patients suffered from pneumocystis pneu1nonia. The condition-the same one observed in the initial C.D.C. report- could be fatal, so many who had it used an experimental antimicrobial medication called pentamidine, which had proved highly effective. But people who took experimental medications were barred from participating in other clinical trials. At first, Fauci held to the standard N.I.H. line that research need not focus on the immediate welfare of patients. "When we had clinical trials, we, the scientific co1nmunity and the regulatory co1nmunity, did not listen" to the activists, he recalled. "It was, at the time, an attitude that many of us had, and I probably had it myself." He was right about that. I covered the AIDS epidemic for the Washington Post, and it was clear to me that Fauci was inclined to enforce the paternalistic medical tradition in which he had trained: doctors and scientists were unquestioned 

authorities, and drug development had to follow a rigid process that included animal testing and rigorous clinical trials. Otherwise , the benefits and the risks of these drugs could not be adequately assessed. In 1987, the F.D.A. approved the first drug to treat H.I.V.- azidothymidine, or AZT-and the announcement was met with a burst of hope. But the drug's liabilities were evident almost instantly. It had harsh side effects, and the benefits wore off; the virus itself soon became resistant to the drug. When new clinical studies began, involving cocktails of AZT and similar compounds, tens of thousands of people asked to participate. Again, though, volunteers were not accepted if they used other experimental drugs. The anger among activists grew 1nore intense. "They started becoming amazingly iconoclastic and confrontational, and that scared the hell out of the scientists, who were fundamentally quite conservative ," Fauci told me at his medical-school reunion. "When they were demonstrating on the N.I.H. campus, disrupting Wall Street, disrupting St. Patrick 's Cathedral, instead of listening to them, scientists withdrew." Without entirely understanding his own motives, Fauci decided to look beyond the activists' furious rhetoric and style. He recalls telling himself, "Let me put aside the goth dress-the earrings and the Mohawk haircuts and the black jackets-and just listen to what they have to say. And what they were saying made absolutely perfect sense." It helped that Fauci had something in common with the activists: "They were all New York guys. I had a little affinity to them because I'm a New Yorker. And I said, What would I do if I were in their shoes? And it was very clear: I would have done exactly the same thing." The activists knew that they were facing a mercilessly lethal disease. In the summer of 1985, I travelled to New York to write my first long story on the toll that the epidemic was taking on the city's gay community. I interviewed dozens of 1nen. To the best of my knowledge, only two of them are still alive: Larry Kramer, who is now eighty-four, and a political activist who prefers to remain anonymous. Fauci, too, came to understand the severity of the crisis. "Everyone died," he said. "I was used to treating people who had little hope and then saving their lives-that was so wonderful. But, with AIDS in those 

days, I saved no one. It was the darkest time of my life." Faced with mounting evidence that his cautious approach made no sense , he did something that few public officials do: he reversed himself. Fauci transformed from a conventional bench scientist into a public-health activist who happened to work for the federal government. "I had to change ," he told me. When the demonstrators marched on the N.I.H . campus in 1988, Fauci no longer saw a threat. "I looked at them, and I saw people who were in pain," he recalled in an article in Holy Cross Magazin e. He asked the police and the F.B.I. not to arrest any of the1n. Then he invited a handful of protest leaders to his office. "That began a relationship over many years ," Fauci said. "They let me into their camp. I went to the gay bathhouses and spoke to them. I went to San Francisco, to the Castro District , and I discussed the problems they were having , the degree of suffering that was going on in the community, the need for them to get involved in clinical trials , since there were no other possibilities for them to get access to drugs. And I earned their confidence." Fauci, in his mid-forties, was the youngest director of an N.I.H. institute in a century , and he lacked the political influence to act independently. Even in his own field , he struggled to recruit allies. "I couldn't convince my own people in infectious-disease leadership to take on H.I.V ./ AIDS," he told me. So he created a division within his institute devoted to the disease. One day, in the late eighties , Fauci asked me to stop by his office in Building 31 on the N.I.H. campus. He told me that he had a wild idea: he wanted to hire Mark Harrington , ACT UP's point man on drug-treatment trials. Harrington, a prominent AIDS researcher and activist, had no formal scientific training. But Fauci , like most of those who had seen him testify before Congress or speak to a crowd , was dazzled by his brilliance. Harrington discussed the idea with Fauci , but decided that the job would be a disaster for him. "There's no way I could have functioned within that bureaucracy, " he told me recently. "The people I respect would have 

seen me as a sellout." Yet Harrington continued to make a profound impression on Fauci' s thinking . Harrington was passionately committed to loosening up the F.D.A.'s restrictive regime. "It was murder," he told me. "I don't know any other way to describe it." Harrington, who went on to win a MacArthur "genius" grant for his work on the disease, established himself as the most knowledgeable student of the agency 's byzantine regulations. In meetings with Fauci and other officials, he urged them to move faster and with greater compassion for those who were suffering. There are three stages in most F.D.A. clinical trials. The first tests whether a drug is safe. The second assesses its efficacy. The last stage, conducted in larger groups, confirms that the drug works and that there are no serious adverse reactions. Harrington argued that people with no alternative should be granted access to those drugs as soon as they had been proved safe, even if their effectiveness remained unknown. At first, Fauci was concerned that, if people taking multiple experimental medications joined clinical trials, the results would be hopelessly muddled. He was also afraid that granting sick people unrestricted access to unapproved drugs would deter them from participating in the trials at all. Harrington and other activists reassured him that they were committed to strictly monitored drug trials that would provide enough data to know what worked and what did not. Fauci is a realist, and the facts were obvious to anyone who cared to look. Traditional methods of testing drugs weren't working. Underground networks were growing everywhere. With so many AIDS patients taking untested medications , federal health officials had to concede that their syste1n was broken. Even the most fundamental protocol of a clinical trial- giving some participants a placebo- came into question. In a study conducted in San Francisco in 1989, nearly all the volunteers had their medicine analyzed, to see whether they were receiving an active dose. Those who learned that they had been given placebos almost invariably dropped out. "There was a feeling in science that doctors know best, scientists know best," Fauci said. "We love our patients, but they don 't really know what's best for them. Then, when we dealt with this disease that was 

brand new- that was frightening, that was killing people in a way that was historic-the people who were impacted by the disease wanted to have something to say about how we conducted research." There were still moments of confrontation. In May, 1990, hundreds of ACT UP activists returned to the N.I.H., demanding more AIDS treatments and greater representation of women and people of color in clinical trials. At a planning session for the protest, a young activist named Tony Malliaris performed a rap song called "Storm the NIH," which included the lyrics "I don't know what Fauci thinks, but this ain't Denmark, and something stinks." (Malliaris died five years later, still in his early thirties.) Fauci was undeterred. He threw his influence behind a program called Parallel Track, which made unapproved AIDS drugs available as soon as they were demonstrated to be safe, even as clinical trials were continuing. The initiative would not have succeeded without Fauci. But he always acknowledged that his approach had been shaped largely by the constructive pressure he received from AIDS advocacy groups and from leaders like Harrington. This more inclusive approach ushered in a revolution in American medicine . Patients today demand as much information as possible about treatments they might receive, and no longer act as if their doctors' advice came straight from Mt. Olympus. They scour the Internet, assemble statistics, and often arrive at the hospital with a folder full of medical information. The F.D.A., for its part, will no longer consider approving a new drug until it has consulted representatives of groups who would use it. "There are strict scientific principles that have to be adhered to in medicine ," Fauci told me. "At the same time, a humanistic touch is needed in dealing with people. You have to combine social aspects, ethical aspects, personal aspects with cold, clean science." In 2002, I wrote a Profile of Larry Kramer for this magazine. By then, he and Fauci had become friends, with each expressing gratitude for the other's work in those years. Fauci told me, "In American medicine , there are two eras: before Larry and after Larry. There is no question in my mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. When all the 

screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain." Kramer, who spent years in a constant rage at Fauci , now calls him "the only true and great hero" among government officials in the AIDS crisis. As Trump defends his Administration's response to the pandemic, he has suggested repeatedly that COVID-19 was impossible to predict. "There's never been anything like this in history ," he said, at a press conference on March 19th. "Nobody knew there would be a pande1nic or epidemic of this proportion." As everyone with even a casual interest in the history of science knows, pandemics have altered the destiny of humanity at least since 430 B.C., when Athens was struck by a plague that killed as many as two-thirds of its residents , just as the Spartans were laying siege. Beginning in 165 A.D. , smallpox helped ruin the Roman Empire , sowing more destruction than foreign armies ever could. And, in the fourteenth century, the Black Death swept through Europe , killing more than half the population, according to recent estimates. Yet, by the middle of the twentieth century, many scientists had begun to conceive of a world that was largely free of infectious epidemics. In 1951, Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, a future Nobel laureate in medicine , wrote, "The fever hospitals are vanishing or being turned to other uses. With full use of the knowledge we already possess, the effective control of every important infectious disease"-with the exception of polio-"is possible. " His optimism was understandable. Antibiotics had made many lethal diseases easy to treat; improvements in sanitary conditions had transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In developed countries, typhoid, cholera, and measles- major killers throughout history - had largely passed into memory; even tuberculosis , one of the great scourges of humanity, had been in decline for nearly half a century. By 1972, Macfarlane , writing with the microbiologist David White, was predicting that the "most likely forecast about the future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull." When Fauci was a young trainee, these kinds of predictions sometimes made him wonder if he had picked the wrong career. "I became 

concerned that I was entering ... an area of biomedical research that was disappearing ," he recalled in one speech. But, since 1984 , when Fauci became the director of NIAID, there has not been a single day in which some epidemic has not threatened the globe. According to the World Health Organization, AIDS has killed more than thirty million people, and nearly forty million are now living with H.I.V. Tuberculosis, far from sliding into obscurity, infects roughly a quarter of the human population ; the W.H.O. says that one and a half 1nillion people died from the disease in 2018. But the greatest threat that humanity faces, by far, is a global outbreak of a lethal virus for which no treatlnent has been found. In just a few months, COVID-19 has forced billions of people , in nearly every country on earth, into a panicked withdrawal from society. Another pandemic like this might appear in two years, or in ten, or in a century. But I have never met a virologist or an epidemiologist who believes we won't encounter one. For a deadly virus to flourish, it must meet three critical conditions. First, a new virus-one to which no one has yet developed immunity￾must emerge from the animal reservoirs that produce and harbor such pathogens. Second , the virus has to make humans sick. (The vast majorit y do not.) Finally, it must be able to spread efficiently, through coughing, sneezing, or shaking hands. That combination is rare, but, when it appears, the consequences are almost always disastrous. The Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg, who died in 2008, was for years the world's most visionary voice about emerging infectious diseases. "Some people think I am being hysterical , but there are catastrophes ahead," he once wrote. "We live in evolutionary competition with microbes- bacteria and viruses. There is no guarantee that we will be the survivors." In 2003 , Lederberg joined the future F.D.A. commissioner Margaret Hamburg and the pandemic specialist Mark Smolinski to edit a seminal report, in which prominent scientists argued for a much more aggressive defense of the planet. Titled "Microbial Threats to Health," the report recommended that the U.S. greatly expand its early-warning systems, particularly in the developing world. It also urged leaders to strengthen 

their ability to respond to microbial threats, with new efforts on the federal, state, and local levels. The recommendations were almost completely ignored. The next year, a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza, H5Nl, leaped from waterfowl to chickens and then to humans. Public-health officials were petrified. In Bangkok , I met with Scott Dowell, who led the Thailand office of the C.D.C.'s International Emerging Infections Program. "The world just has no idea what it's going to see if this thing comes," he told me. He paused and then reframed his thought. "When, really. It's when. I don't think we can afford the luxury of the word 'if anymore." In a sense, the world was lucky with H5Nl. Although the U.S. and other countries mounted a diffident response, the virus turned out to be deadly but not very contagious. Five years later, the situation was reversed. A new influenza virus, designated HINI, infected nearly a quarter of the global population before vaccines became widely available. This time, the virus was highly contagious but not nearly as deadly as most strains of influenza. The fact that the outbreak was less virulent than public￾health officials had feared created its own danger; by encouraging complacency, it did more to expose the world to the risk of a devastating new pandemic than anything else that had happened in decades. Although Congress had appropriated money to stockpile antiviral medications and protective gear, many scientists felt that the effort was grossly insufficient. "We spend many billions of dollars every year on missile-defense systems," Seth Berkley, a medical epidemiologist who leads the Global Vaccine Alliance, told me. "And yet we will not spend pennies on the dollar to prepare for a catastrophe that is far more likely to affect us all." After the Ebola outbreak of 2014, Barack Obama implemented one of Lederberg's central rec01nmendations: he established the White House's National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, an early-warning system for disease in the developing world. Trump disbanded it in 2018, as part of an effort to streamline the N.S.C. In an appearance before Congress, Fauci was asked if the decision was a mistake. He responded diplomatically: "I wouldn't 

necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there." The combination of money and political will can have extraordinary effects on public health. Under the George W. Bush Administration, Fauci was the principal architect of a landmark program called PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. By the time Bush took office, therapies for H.I.V. had become widely available in Western countries. But, for millions of people in the developing world, these drugs were too expensive or too difficult to obtain. Bush felt that it was unacceptable for the poorest people on earth to die because they could not afford medication that was dispensed routinely in the rich world. He asked Fauci to implement an initiative to prevent and treat H.I.V. on a global scale. It has been uniformly held up as a model of the ways in which global public-health programs can save lives. "PEPF AR has turned around declining life expectancies in many countries and likely saved some countries-even an entire continent￾from economic ruin," Harold Varmus, a former director of the N.I.H. and of the National Cancer Institute , wrote in the quarterly journal Science & Diplomacy. But Fauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to attack the problems that he considers most worrisome. Over the years, he has become concerned about the possible impact of new viruses, particularly a lethal strain of influenza. Other viruses are more consistently deadly; some , like measles, are more contagious. But no virus that we know of is capable of killing as rapidly and as efficiently. "We need a major paradigm shift with influenza vaccines," Fauci told me, four years ago. "The situation is a mess." Because the flu virus evolves so rapidly, experts deciding how to formulate vaccines can make only a highly educated guess about which strains are most likely to make people sick. Each February, epidemiologists study outbreaks around the world-especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way- to assess which strains might make their way north. The result is always better than 

nothing. In many years, though, it is woefully inadequate. In the flu season of 2014-15 , the vaccine protected less than a fifth of the people who received it. In 2017-18, it worked for a little more than a third. Fauci has long supported the development of an alternative: a universal influen za vaccine, which would provide lasting defense against all strains. "Similar to tetanus, a universal flu vaccine probably would be given every ten years, " he said. "And, if you get one that is really universal , you can vaccinate just about everyone in the world." But such a vaccine would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and test- and would replace a product that most consumers already think of as good enough. No one has come close to raising the money that such a project will require. By the beginning of the new millennium , it had become clear that the next microbial threat might not come from a bat or a duck. It could just as well be created by a human being. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, anonymous letters laced with deadly anthrax spores began arriving at media companies and congressional offices. In the following months, twenty-two people were infected by inhaling anthrax and five died. Suddenly , biological terror posed an entirely new threat￾one that has become only more significant and complex in the ensuing years. In 2016, James Clapper, who was the director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration , listed gene editing as a potential weapon of mass destruction. Many scientists were furious, but he had a point. Researchers have deployed these tools to rewrite the genes of mosquitoes so that they are unable to transmit malaria. If their success in the lab translates to the field, it will be a historic triumph. But the research also raises an alarming possibility: if a scientist can modify the genes of an insect to protect people from malaria, he could almost certainly use the same technology to add a deadly toxin. Fauci often cites a similar but more immediate paradox. Thanks to genetic engineering , we are more equipped than ever to respond to the threat of a viral pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak began, it took scientists less than a month to sequence the genome of the virus. By the 

end of February, the instructions were on the Internet, and the virus had been re-created in laboratories around the world, by scientists seeking to develop drugs and vaccines. And yet, despite our mastery of molecular biology, we live in an era in which someone can wake up with an infection in China-or France , Australia, or any other place with an airport- and fly to San Francisco in time for dinner, spreading the virus long before he suspects that there 's anything wrong. For most of human history , a virus like COVlD-19 might have killed many people in the community where it originated, but then stopped spreading. According to a comprehensive analysis carried out by the Times, at least four hundred and thirt y thousand people have arrived in the U .S. on direct flights from China since the outbreak began. Forty thousand have arrived in the two months since Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China trying to enter the country. Fauci insists that an adequate defense against future pandemics will have to be flexible . "I have been saying for eight , ten years that we should make a list of microbes and try to develop a basic platform vaccine," he told me in 2016. A platform vaccine addresses an entire class of virus, not just a particular strain. "We keep trying to develop a vaccine for one thing-usually the last one-and it's a waste of time ," he said. "Every time we get hit, it is always something we didn 't expect. So, instead of predetermining what it is you're going to prepare for, make universal platforms. " Such an approach is eminently possible. Using gene-sequence information and synthetic DNA , biologists are now capable of making parts of a vaccine in advance . It takes almost no time to sequence a viral strain , and with that information it should be possible to complete a bespoke vaccine in a matter of weeks. "You could build a chassis for the vaccine, and you would have it on the shelf," Fauci said. "Then all you would need to do is insert the gene of the protein you want to express and make a gazillion doses and send it out. " There are even more futuristic aspirations: the genomics pioneer J. Craig Venter has proposed using a sort of 3-D printer to manufacture vaccines on demand. It is already possible to print the nucleotides that make up DNA and asse1nble them. Venter argues that , in the time it takes for an 

infected person to fly from one side of the world to the other, we should be able to print, assemble, and administer a vaccine. To even contemplate creating these kinds of treatments, Fauci says, would require building an entirely new system for making vaccines before a pandemic arises. But, in addition to the scientific obstacles, this would cost billions of dollars, and no company or politician has been willing to spend the money. Perhaps, just as AIDS transformed our approach to clinical trials, our experience with co vro-19 will change our attitudes about preventing infectious diseases. A proper investment in both research and emergency preparedness would have prevented at least some of the unspeakable human loss we are now experiencing and the economic crash that has just begun. The COVID-19 epidemic will eventually fade, but the public will demand a reckoning. Inevitably, there will be an investigation , along the lines of the 9/ 11 Commission , to look into the ramifications of the President's denialism, the shortages in testing and medical equipment, and the dismissal of so many warning signs. Fauci will not necessarily escape criticism. He is an excellent spokesman for the value of scientific research, but he runs a single institute , and he lacks the authority to broadly reshape our response to pandemics. "The kinds of things we really desperately need as foundational tools for dealing with this stuff aren 't necessarily research enterprises," Harold Varmus told me. "Tony isn't running C.D.C. He's not running FEMA. To tell him to stockpile defense mechanisms or to move forward surveillance tools into massive operations around the world- that's just not his remit." Even Fauci' s current value as a scientific adviser has been limited by the President's conte1npt for expertise. Trump 's coronavirus kitchen cabinet consists of people like his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has no medical knowledge or experience managing crises-yet has been appointed to direct the response to the biggest medical emergency since the influenza pandemic of 1918. Trump has also turned for advice to Dr. Mehmet Oz, who for years has endorsed worthless treatments and used his television show to promote notorious quacks. Trump even seems to think that his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, should debate Fauci about the value of specific drugs. When Navarro , who has a doctoral degree in 

economics, was asked about his medical qualifications , he said, "I have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics , or whatever." Among Navarro 's enthusiasms is the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine , which he believes could cure COVID-19. There is currently no evidence to support this conclusion , as Fauci has pointed out on several occasions. On April 5th, as Trump continued to tout the drug as a miracle cure, a reporter at the daily briefing asked Fauci to com1nent. Trump refused to allow him to speak. In an appearance two days later, Trump kept up the hype. "I say try it," he said. "You're not gonna die from this pill." Not long afterward , he even suggested that zinc might help. To plan a coherent biological future , rather than simply scramble to contain each new pandemic , will require an entirely new kind of political commitment. It would certainly include the creation of a permanent position , a special assistant to the President for biological defense. Similar job s have existed in the past, but not for long, and not with enough influence to matter. David Reiman , the Stanford professor , told me, "This kind of job needs somebody with the authorit y to preside over domestic and international threats, both natural and deliberate. And that person has to sit in the White House with immediate access to the President. Without that, we will really have nothing that can work." Until then, we have Fauci, a seventy-nine-year-old infectious-disease expert pinned between Donald Tru1np and the American people. It can 't be easy. As Fauci recently put it, with characteristic candor, "I give the appearance of being optimistic. But, deep down, I just do everything I possibly can, assuming that the worst will happen , and I've got to stop the worst from happening." ♦ Published in the print edition of the April 20, 2020 , issue, with the headline "The Good Doctor ."

Photograph by Lo Scalzo/ Bloomberg/ Getty WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)- ln what he described as a "potentia lly major breakthrough," Dr. Anthony Fauci has convinced Donald Trump to attack COVID-19 as if it were an inspector general. Fauci, who has been frustrated in his efforts to get th rough to Trump, compared the global pandemic to an inspector general while in a closed-door meeting with the President on Wednesday. "Wha t do you hate more than anything, Mr. President?" Fauci asked. "Jim Acosta," Trump immed iately replied. "O.K., fine. But, besides Jim Acosta," Fauci said, "it would be an inspecto r general, right?" "You're right, Tony," Trump agreed. "I hate those losers." "Well, think of COV/0-19 as the worst inspector general in the world," Fauci continued. "It's overseeing everything you do and making you follow the law. It's keeping you from spending taxpayer money on anything you want. You wouldn't stand for that , would you?" Reportedly, Trump appeared shaken by Fauci's analogy. "Damn it, Tony, when you put it that way, we've got to do something about COVID-19," he said. Speaking to reporters, Fauci said that he was "cautiously optimistic" that his inspector-general analogy would finally spur Trump to action, but added, "Jared could still screw this up."

The Italian Ambassador, Mr. Varricchio, would be delighted if you accept to be his guest of honor at the event and asked me to informally enquire with you, before sending an official invitat ion, if there is any chance you could part icipate. He understands how crazy your schedule is during this crisis. They would like you to deliver a 30 min lecture on a theme of your choice, preferably related to the state of the art of the pandemic management. The tentative date for the event is between April 20 and April 30, but they are waiting to finalize the date based on your preference, if you are able to accept (even in early May).

Mostly these are two second yes or no answers - though I need to understand the b cell issue better. Thank you for all this. Hang in there: 1.) Fauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to attack the problems that he considers most woJTisome. Over the years, he has become especially concerned about the possible impact of a lethal strain of influenza." True, but I almost qualified the 

statement and said it most likely would be inJluenza, but I was concerned with any type of novel respiratory virus that efficiently spread from human to human and that had a high degree of morbidity and mortality 2.) Dyker Heights versus Bensonhurst: • • What do we say about where he grew up.? He always says Bensonhurst. The • apartment was technically in Dyker Heights, though the neighborhood lines shift. And I never see him mention moving neighborhoods. Did he move? Yes. I moved. I was born at (b) (6>.n the middle of the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. When I was 9 year s old my father opened a Pharmacy on 8302-13 th Avenue at the outer edge of the Dyker Heights Section of Brooklyn (only We moved into an apartment over the pharmacy . 3.) [ the question below is the meaning of hyperactive. Does it mean producing too many B cells or that they were too active, as in working too hard, producing too many antibodies??) Not necessarily too many B cells. It means that the B cells that are there, are aberrantly turned on He had been investigating B-cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies. In 1983-before H.l.V. was even known by that name-his lab became the first to report that B-cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS. The virus was somehow leading its hosts to overproduce a defense that normally would keep them healthy. Fauci had identified one of the crucial features of AIDS. "We made that observation without having any idea of what we were dealing with," he said. "l think that speaks for sound scientific and clinical observation ." The politics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage. • 4.). This I asked before you could not speak to me but we can take me out of it. Or do whatever you like: I asked Fauci if he thought that novel coronavirus would force a change in attitude among olitical leaders and funding agencies. (b) (6)1 (b)(6) • 5.). This you lrnve said in rnore than one place. People kind of became alarmed when you were absent so just want to be sure you don't mind it in here: No problem . Fauci said that there was nothing meaningful about his absence from the Mar.23 White House briefing, "I was tied up in a task force meeting, and we were trying to work out some difficult policies and the topic of the briefing that day was more related to other members of the Task Force. He also said, '41 have no trouble with the President. When .I talk to him, he listens.''

The program is effective today and 

covers most Lilly insulins. Details and more informa tion can be found in the press release here attached. Lilly has introduced several solutions in recent years to help meet the individual financial circumstances of people living with diabetes that are still in effect during the COVID-19 crisis, including: • The Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, through which representatives can direct people to the $35 savings card, as well as affordability option s that may reduce their out-of-pocke t costs further - such as free insulin for people with minimal income, or no income at all, that has been donated by Lilly to non-profit organizati ons. • Three non-branded versions of our insulin options with list prices 50 percent lower than the branded versions. • In January, the company announced plans to donate at least 200,000 KwikPens® to relief agencies over the next three years.

I appreciate your help and introductions on how our players can be helpful. As you know Drew and Brittany Brees made a $SM contribution to the Louisiana coronavirus efforts and they have done a lot of press. Drew's message has been "Hang in there-hang tough I We are in th is t ogether." I've done several webinars with our players and their fami lies, both educating them and pointing out thei r role both with friends and fam ily as well as on social media to let NFL fans know that whether or not we have an NFL season depends to a large extent upon those fans following the guidelines zealously-as zealously as they follow NFL games! That message seems to be getting through . I write now with a request for a litt le bit of Dr. Fauci's time in about 2 weeks. I requested that we stand up a joint NF LP A-NFL Task Force to scenario plan a pathway to getting NFL Club facilities open, with a view towards if and when we might look towards an NFL season, even if games are played with no fans. My request is to have Dr. Fauci give a telephone briefing to our group on this difficult topic, which would of course be confidential. The floor would be his and I can brief him prior to the call on what we have been working on. If he were willing, we can do the call anytime, probably during the week of April 13, although of course the modeling shows that would be during the peak of the outbreak. We could also do it the week befo re or after. Thanks so much fo r considering this . We are mindful of the psychological toll the virus is taking and the lift NFL games would give to a sports-starved population, but only if it can be done safely for the players and the fans who (ultimately) allow them to play this great game. Again, thanks! Best, Doc Thom Mayer, MD, FACEP, FAAP, FACHE Medical Director NFLPA NFL Players Association 11150 Sunset Hills Road, Ste 305 Reston. VA 20190

I hope you are well and I wanted to check in to see how you are doing in this scary and traumatic time for our world. During these times, I'm especially thankful for the training I received from the Fogarty Institute. I remember your wise words at our Fogarty orientation in 2011- on why investing in Global health is so critical. No truer words have been spoken especially at times like these! I'm currently communicating with my former colleagues in Zambia (Mpanji and Innocent pictured here with me https ://www.thermofisher.com/blog/behi ndt hebench/ usi ng-sa nger-seq uen ci ng-to - detect-d rug-resistance-m utations-i n-h iv-i n-za m b ia/) from CIDRZ to see how testing can be brought up via the public health infrastructure in place currently. Thankfully, the number of cases is very low, although the unreported cases are much higher than likely captured ( https://www .arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index .html#/bda7594740 fd402994 23467b4 8e9ecf6 ) . My friend who is a Lieutenant Physician actually likely contracted COVID-19 in January and wrote that she and others had treated a patient returning from Wuhan who was pregnant of respiratory illness upon coming back to Lusaka to deliver, only to die of pleural effusion later. They subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and resolved, but these are the types of cases that likely go undetected and can potentially contribute to community spread of the disease . Thank you again for being such a wonderful role model, and I look to leaders like you and Dr. Fauci to help our nation think with prudent but difficult decisions . Kind regards, Lillian

I wil l plan to submit pretty much the same thing every day. I will not Glog your in-box with it unless there is a significant update. RFI from Staff Sec: 1. For tomorrow's press conference , what information or topics do you recommend be included in the President's remarks? Please provide talking point-level details and support. Nothing specific from NIAID at this time. 2. For tomorrow's press conference , on what information (if any) do you intend to speak? SpeGific topics will depend on questions from reporters. Dr. Fauci has been asked about the effect of social distancing; considerations that would facto r into returning the country to normal life; off-label use of treatments such as hydrochloroquine ; the status of clinical trials ; and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. NIAID-specif ic talking points: • NIAID has mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop effective countermeasures for COVID-19, including diagnost ics, vaccines to prevent disease and treatments. 

• NIAID is supporting a clinical trial of the antiviral remdesivir and is investigating other treatments , including antibody therapies and other antivirals , for their activity against SARS-CoV-2 . Well-designed clinical trials are the best way to evaluate potential treatments for safety and efficacy . • NIAID is supporting an early-stage clinical trial of an investigational vaccine called mRNA-1273, developed by NIAID scientists and the biotechnology company Moderna. The study launched first in Seattle, with a second site recently added in Atlanta . NIAID is researching additional vaccine candidates. • NIAID has launched a serosurvey study that aims to determine how many adults in the United States without a confirmed history of COVID-19 have antibodies to the virus . Researchers will collect and analyze blood samp les from as many as 10,000 adu lt volunteers without a confirmed history of COV ID-19 . The results will help illumina te the extent to which the novel coronavirus has spread undetected in the United States and provide insights into which communities and populations are most affected. [NOTE : Thi s serosurvey is for research purposes. It is not meant to be a way fo r people to access antibody testing for personal knowledge of prior infection history. If it is portrayed as a way for people to "get tested " to understand their own infection history , we can expect that peop le will inaccurately blame the government for not receiving results in a timely manner . People can request to learn about their results, which will be available only after weeks or months of analysis.] • NIAID is expanding its portfolio of basic research on coronaviruses and emerging pathogens to characterize SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID￾19) and understand how it causes disease. NIAID also is using animal models to better understand the infection and to investigate optimal ways to treat and prevent COV ID-19 . 3. Are there topics or announcements for future press conferences (other than tomorrow's) that you would like to flag for the President's speechwriting team? - For HHS to - consider mentioning: -------------- (b) (5) From: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [El -------- (b)(6) Sent : Sunday, April 12, 2020 1:55 PM ------~ = To: Billet, Courtney (NIH/NIAID) [El (b)(6) Subject: RE: Staff Sec POC - NIAID

Hi again Paul, One more question - is the pharma collaboration mentioned in the BioCentury story below the same th ing as the Gates COVID Therapeutic Accelerator Program? Or is this something different? I'm just trying to understand the landscape. Best, Francis Pharmas on one page with action plan to solve COVID-19 together BIOCENTURY IS PROVIDING THIS STORY FOR FREE GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 CRISIS. BY C. SIMONE FISHBURN, EDITOR IN CHIEF I MAR 25, 2020 I 9:17 PM EDT A grand-sca le behind -t he-scenes effort by the pharmaceutical companies is under way to expedite the creation of therapies and vaccines to treat COVID-19. According to the participants who spoke with BioCentury under conditions of anonymity, R&D heads from at least 10 companies have been gathering several times a week, setting in motion an action plan to use their top talent in different disciplines to produce an industry-wide response, the likes of which haven't been seen since the private sector's coordinated contribution during World War II. Regulatory heads and manufacturing heads have been holding meetings as well, coordinating to minimize duplication of effort, streamline work and advance efficient testing of compounds and vaccines. The R&D group is creating working principles to accelerate new COVID-19 therapies and vaccines agnostic to their market potential , eliminating bureaucratic and technical or scientific barriers, and focusing on filling gaps not adequately filled by other initiatives and which the consortium is uniquely suited to address. NIH-000213 

The pharma group's leaders also intend to offer resources to biotechs and academic groups pursuing countermeasures who may not want to join the effort but could benefit from expert guidance. Flying the plane as they build it, the collaborators intend to create a clearing house of ideas for testing of molecu les and vaccines, with working groups to vet the ideas and expedite testi ng on the most promising via clinical or preclin ical testing. According to the participants who spoke to BioCentury, the structure will probably evolve over time. Currently, the model involves five working groups, for clinical phase repurposing, novel small molecule antivirals, novel antibodies, prevent ive vaccines and preclinical repurposing. Each will be headed by a pharma R&D executive and will be responsible for prioritizing poten tial compounds and specifying actions. Two platform groups will integrate across modalities: a clinical trial acceleration group and a data sharing group. "This is not a t ime to think about proprietary information or IP or margins. We need to break down the barriers and solve the problem," said one participant involved in the consortium.

As I mentioned, Mikael Dolsten has been quite enthusiastic. For FDA, Peter Marks, Janet Woodcock, and Steve Hahn were all extremely positive about this opportunity for a shared consideration about priorit ies. Tony Fauci and his team are totally in favor, and the FNIH (David Whalley and Maria Freire) stands ready to serve as convener . I thought the first step would be a 90 to 120-minute virtual meeting - hopefully next week. Attached is a draft precis of what t his might look like; I have left out the roster because that is very much a work in progress.

Several pharmas and biotechs have been reaching out to NIH to ident ify viral assays and animal models that can NIH-0002 15 

NIH-000216 be run in a BSL-3 facility. Other similar contacts I've had with pharma and biotech tell me that there is a high degree of interest and willingness to combine forces at this time of crisis. This isn't exactly a precise recipe for AMP-COVID, but it has some of the same flavor. Would it be useful for FNIH to convene a virtua l meeting with a few heads of R&D (hopefully you; Mikael Dolsten has already expressed enthusiasm; and I'd be interested in your suggestions of others), FDA (Marks and Woodcock), leaders from NIAID and a few other NIH Institutes with equity in this space. We might be able to make a short list of catalytic actions that neither sector can do optimally right now, but together we can do rapidly . The focus would be on therapeutics and vaccines. But I can imagine a separate session on diagnostics . Does this sound worthwh ile to you? Thanks, I always value your advice and partnership . Francis

This issue is now being actively discussed at the Task Force meetings . No guarantee, but I believe that there will be movement in that direction. Best regards, Tony From : Kavesh, William (b)( > Sent: Monday, March 30, 2020 5:10 PM ------~~ To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E] (b)(6) Subject: Medical staff need COVID-19 NIH survival data on N-95 respirators to help alleviate shortage Dear Dr. Fauci, The biggest concern of my hospital colleagues is the shortage of protective masks. If any research is being done that might drive safe reuse of N-95 respirators, no one I know has seen it. These should be simple studies to do. If the virus is shown to die within a few days and moisture dries up, then the number of masks needing disposal could drop drastically. In that situation, each provider at risk could be given five N-95 masks, one for each day of the week . The provider would wear the N-95 mask for one working day, say Monday. and then place it into a paper bag in a secure location. The provider would not use that mask again until the following Monday; ie seven days later. The only question, then, would be: how many times can this be repeated? Will the mask lose any protective qualities over time? Please assign someone to do these studies soon. I'm also very pleased that our national leaders now seem to be listen ing to you more closely. Thank you for your efforts. William Kavesh MD, MPH CMC Philadelphia VA Medical Center NIH-000117

NIH-000003 

NIH-000004 The International mRNA Health Conference is a yearly non-profit event collaboratively organized by Curevac , BioNTech and Moderna. It brings together academic and industry thought leaders in the mRNA design and delivery space to explore the rapidly evolving science , business and regulatory landscape of mRNA medicines. Over the last seven years , this 2-day conference has become the premier destination for industry and academic professionals to network with colleagues , learn about the latest advances in mRNA technology, and to attend scientific presentations given by the most esteemed experts in the field. Notably, it is the only annual conference dedicated solely to mRNA therapeutics. As a scientist with tremendous experience and the director of NIAID, the organizing committee thought that conference attendees would very much appreciate hearing about your thoughts about mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines, and any perspectives you wish to share. The organizing committee recognizes that your calendar is likely filled years in advance, but we all have our fingers crossed that you might be able to fit this into your busy schedule. I look forward to hearing from you. all best wishes, Norbert P.S. In the event that the COVID-19 crisis is still curtailing travel in the fall, our backup plan would be to have a completely virtual meeting on the same dates. We plan to make that decision in late AugusUearly September. Norbert Pardi, Ph.D. Research Assistant Professor of Medicine Infectious Disease Division Perelman School of Medicine

It is now officially published at : https://who.int/who-documents-detail/interim-recommendations-on-obligatory-hand￾hygiene-against-transmission-of-covid -19 I attach a pdf copy for easy reference . I wou ld like to request your support in promoting the recommendation as part of an international emergency response operation providing universal access to mandatory hand hygiene and/or sanitat ion against COVID-19 infect ions. Provided it is now made available and made obligatory whenever entering NIH-000027 

and leaving a facility to wh ich the general public has access, it could become possible to prevent most smear infections by decontaminating all hands prior and after each possible contamination, both active or passive. In addition, the measure should massively reduce transmission of other viruses and bacteria currently burdening diffe rential diagnosis of COVID-pneumonias. Based on the excellent experiences made with the acceptability and adherence during Ebola outbreaks, repeated mandatory hand hygiene or sanitation should thus become an almost unconscious routine of everyday life for any person having to leave his or her private home in Corona-affected countries. I have been asked by senior WHO emergency management to promote the WHO recomme ndati on for rapid implementation with particular focus on current COVID-19 transmission epicenters such as the USA. Providing a systematic access to hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory prior to entering and whenever leaving any public facility will also provide a safety net whenever current restrictions on movements and commerce are to be progressively reduced. Given the high resource settings in the current COVID-epicentres, and the negligible cost of implemen ting this public health emergency measure compared to prolonged mass confinement without safe exit strategy, I do presume that the wherewithal to carry it out will not be limiting facto r. Thank you for considering the collaboration in this emergency measure proposed within th e USA at the largest possible scale. WHO has requested IFRC to alert the American Red Cross to support large scale implementation should your Government decide to implement the public health measure proposed.

Long term use of PPls reduce the pH of the stomach from 1 to 5. This reduction in stomach acid reduces the body's ability to fight viruses. In addition, the lower stomach pH reduce the ability to absorb key nutrients that require gastric acid for breakdown and absorption (calcium, vitamin C & 812, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc). Lack of proper nutrients lead to a compromised immune system. Seniors and individua ls with chronic illnesses are at higher risk of ploypharmacology and dying from Covid-19 due to PPls. The more medicat ions an individual tak es, the more likely they will suffer from acid reflux and thus be prescribed a PPL Thank you for your commitment and compassion during the pandemic.

I hope that you do not mind me contacting you, but I wanted to bring your attention to a clinical trial that is currently taking place in China on COVID-19 patients with high dose IV Vitamin C. There are reports of some early successes with this treatment and I wondered if this could be a possible stop gap treatment - that cou ld possibly save many lives - whi le we await the development of suitable drug treatments and a reliable vaccine. The trial in China is not due to conclude until September of this year, however, previous trials of IV Vitamin C have shown it to be a very safe treatment with litt le or no adverse side effects. I have read tha t the Northwell Hospital Group in New York, which operates 23 hospitals, have already started to give this treatment to many of their COVID-19 patients. This treatment also appears to meet the normally required criteria for a clinic trial. The treatment has been shown to be: 1) Effective (Please see the link below to the promising tria l results currently taking place in China). 2) Safe (The treatment has been shown to be safe in many previous tr ials going back well over 40 years). 3) Correct dosage is understood (The dosage is fully understood - please see the attached Protocol). 4) The correct patients to give this treatment to (Virtually everyone in hospital infected with COVID-19). 5) The correct time in the illness to give the treatment (As soon as the infected patient comes into hospita l).

I want to help relay your message of COVID-19 information for state of New Hampshire, by conducting a Facebook Live chat with myself to project information and messages to the citizens of New Hampshire . This is a chance for us to chat for around 10 minutes and ta lk with a first responder to the general public. I have seen you do interviews with the media/ daytime talk shows, a Facebook live chat with Mark Zuckerberg, and even an lnstagram live video with Stephen Curry from the Golden State Warriors. I run the social media aspect of the departmen t, and I would love to do a 10-15 minute discussion (with information to the public, as well as some question and answer) with you on Facebook (live) to have the general public watch us talk about the pandem ic and the next steps, and also maybe take some questions asked of the publ ic watch ing when they comment. I also w ill be reaching out to the New Hampshire State Governor Chris Sununu and Dr. Benjamin P. Chan (who is the state's epidemiologist). I would love to have them chat with me, and have you join in on the discussion as well. I have no confirmed with them if they are available yet, but I am putting things in motion. I know that if I was able to set up a time and date that would work around your busy and important schedule, then I could with ample time promote it. I would love to not only get the town on Milford to watch th is, but have the state of New Hampshire and other states nearby tune in. I know this is a long shot and that you have way more important aspects of your job to complete, but I think th is an important time to have the public hear you talk. Please let me know if this could be possible and I would love to set this up, I don't expect to take too much of your time if this can happen. Sometimes in life you just need to ask and see what happens and this is a time where that risk is worth it to have a conversation with you about this pandemic we are facing, especially as we ramp up for starting to "peak" in the number of people affected .

Fauci, director of the Nation al Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, rest on a plate at Donuts Delite in Rochester, N.Y., on March 25. (Shawn Dowd/Rochester Democrat & Chronicle/AP) By Antonia Noori Farzan March 31, 2020 at 5:15 a.m. EDT Early last week, Nick Semeraro wanted to find a way to hono r Antho ny S. Fauci. As the owner of a small doughnut shop in Rochester, N.Y., he had been closely tracking the latest news about the coronavi rus pandemic. And night after night, he'd been impressed by how Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, approached the crisis in a calm, knowledgeable manner. So, as a tribute , Semeraro put th e renowned immunologist's face on a doughnut. Expecting to sell a few hundred, he was shocked when the store sold out day after day, with thousands flying off the shelves. Donuts Delite was besieged w ith requests to ship the buttercream-frosted creat ions all over the country, and one Fauci fan drove three hours just to pick up a dozen. Soon, bakeries in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania followed suit, using edible paper to decorate pastries with Fauci's likeness. "We had no idea it was going to blow up thi s big," Semeraro told CNN."We didn't know everyone else felt the same way we did ." While Fauci was already a respected scientist before the outbre ak, his appearances during White House press briefings have made him a household name and an unlikely celebrity . With his NIH-000096 

NIH-000097 straightforward demeanor and willingness to contradict President Trump, he's begun to develop the same kind of cult following as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former special counsel Robert S. Mueller Ill, who inspired countless "Plank like RBG" tank tops and a bizarre illustrated children's book, respectively . Even as whole swaths of the global economy collapse, the pandemic has created a robust cottage industry of Fauci-themed merchandise, including bottle openers, magnets and mugs. On Etsy, you can buy "Honk for Dr. Fauci" bumper stickers, prayer candles depicting "St. Fauci" and socks printed with Fauci's face. Graphic T-shirts bear slogans such as "I Need a Hero" and "In Dr. Fauci We Trust." If so inclined, you can even decorate your home with an "I Heart Dr. Fauci" throw pillow, or purchase a replica of Fauci's jersey from the time he captained the basketball team at Manhattan's Regis High School. Lingua Franca, which sells cashmere sweaters embroidered with resistance-fr iendly slogans for $380 and up, recently began taking orders for an army-green "Dr. Fauci Fan Club" knit. In honor of Fauci's Italian heritage, a clam bar in Long Island named a linguine dish after him this week . (Available for pickup only, "the linguine with white clam sauce shares origins with Fauci, as the sauce itself was invented in the Fauci Family's native Sciacca, Italy," the restaurant claimed in a statement.) As countless Americans remain glued to the news while trying to stay indoors, a robust Fauci fandom has flourished on line. On Face book, the "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci Fan Club" has over 32,000 members. Thousands more congregate in groups with names such as "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Man, the Myth, the Legend," "Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen" and "Dr. Fauci Memes for Social Distance Teens." An unassuming 79-year-old public servant who has advised six presidents, Fauci has become a "reliable constant in a time of uncertainty," The Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy and Ben Terris reported . But his admirers - and there are a lot of them - worry that it's only a matter of time before he's sidelined by Trump . When Fauci missed a White House news conference earlier this month, panic erupted on Twitter, along with speculation that he could be sick. There was palpable relief when he resumed his regular position at the podium the following day and appeared to hide some exasperation as Trump referenced "the deep state." Fauci later explained that he had simply been trying to dislodge a lozenge from his throat . But the much-analyzed "Fauci facepalm" had already become a meme, deployed by liberal members of what's known as the resistance. Fauci's newfound fame can be partially attributed to his willingness to engage with all forms of media - in recent weeks, he's gone on a Barstool Sports podcast, chatted with basketball star Steph Curry on lnstagram Live as Barack Obama listened in, and appeared on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah." But it also undoubtedly helps that his fans tend to take social distancing seriously and consequently have ample spare time to produce fan art or perform songs written (or modified) in his honor . On social media, Fauci's virtual fan clubs peruse old photos of the infectious disease expert in search of "comfy turtleneck vibes," stitch his face on embroidery hoops and discuss erecting statues as tribute . They frost his name on cookies and joke about constructing shrines in his honor. Prominent activists and entertainers confess to wanting to marry him, or have him tuck them into bed. Fauci has remained characteristically modest about his new status as a cult figure. "Well, that's very nice," he responded when McCarthy and Terris mentioned that people all over the country were praying for him. Of course, that means that his fan base has only continued to grow. "I never met a guy that, worldwide, he is so loved," Semeraro, the Rochester doughnut shop owner,to ld CNN. "And a month ago, we never knew his first and last name."

(6): = > Subject: Invitation to be the keynote speaker at an Insurance Medicine Conference in Washington, DC in October . Dear Dr. Fauci, I hope this email finds you wel l. It is abundantly obvious from the countle ss sifts through data and tallies of cases, interviews and press conferences, social media appearances, etc. that your schedule is crazy these days. As a practicing physician and an American, I am proud to be represented by you and thank you for your efforts on our behalf. I realize with your schedule and with the thousands of emails, this one may not make it, but I wanted to take a shot in the dark. I am currently the Chief Medical Off icer of a reinsurer and am on the planning committee for the American Academy of Insurance Medicine's annual meeting which will be held in DC th is year October 18-21. Dr. Michael Osterholm had agreed to speak at the conference back in January as our first keynote speaker on the subject of pandemics, preparedness. I'd heard him speak before at Prudential (I was medical director there and we were a member company of CIDRAP) and his ta lk mirrored his book which I've also read. Regretfully, 2 weeks ago I received notice from Laurel, his EA, that he is unable to attend the meeting because he needs to travel to London that week for a meeting he is heading. I think that a talk on the topic is a must at any medical meeting and after hearing your pressers and coming to rely on your sage status updates and advice, coupled with the fact that the conference is in DC, I thought I'd give this a shot . Would you be AAIM's keynote speaker this year? In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we understand many industry conferences have had to be canceled. We are continui ng to closely monitor the trend of the COVID-19 virus, and may have to do the same for the AAIM meeting in October, but if there is an opportunity to gather and learn, we'd like to prepare for it . The audience is medical directors that work in the life, health, disability and longterm care space. Some are clinically active . Some of them are resources for health emergency planning fo r their companies. The audience comes mostly from North America, although other countries/continents are well represented. The purpose of the meeting is really to illustrate novel trends in the industry that will likely impact morbidi ty and mortality in the near or distant future . We've had talks on CRISPR, marijuana, precision medicine, data analytics. They're not hard core morbidity or mortality focused, but do touch on it . NIH-000121 

NIH-000122 Given the scope of the meeting and the attendees and industries they represent, I think that a lecture on pandemics, bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease, especially in light of COVID-19, is necessary. I think you would teach new concepts to a team of doctors that would identify with some of the system gaps in our current supply chain and their impact on human health, wellbeing and survival. You'd provide experience and insight on what went wrong and what could be fixed in the future to make us collectively better prepared. We would be honored to have you speak and I'm glad to continue discussion of logistics with someone else on your team. If you needed more information about scope, I can certainly provide that. We do provide an honorarium and will cover travel and hotel expenses. Thanks so much in advance for any consideration you might give this request/offer and most of all thank you for your direction, demeanor and dedicat ion at this global time of crisis.

It re orts new medical research that has et to be evaluated and so should not be used to uide clinical practice. • Abstract • Info/H isto ry • Met rics • • • Preview PDF Abstract Summary Background The novel coronav irus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countr ies. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor . Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertens ion comorbid ity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or th iazide to treat preexisting hypertens ion prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospect ive study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertens ion como rbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, th iazide), or none. A meta -analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published stud ies. Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% Cl 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morb idity and mortality of pneumon ia. Interpretat ion Elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorb idity who are tak ing ARB anti -hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertens ion drugs.

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectio us Diseases, speaks with th e coronavirus task forc e at th e Wh ite House on Tuesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Ray Greenberg March 27, 2020 at 3:34 p.m . EDT Ray Greenberg is a physician epidemiolog ist, former executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Texas System and the author of "Medal Winners: How the Vietnam War Launched Nobel Careers." NIH-000166 

NIH-000167 Americans may have the war in Vietnam to thank for Anthony S. Fauci. An adviser to six presidents and now the trusted public face of the scientific response to the coronavirus pandemic, Fauci has worked at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than a half-century - beginning in 1968 with a group of doctors cheekily known as Yellow Berets. During the conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, the U.S. military faced a pressing need for physicians. In 1966, during Fauci's senior year at Cornell University Medical College, a military recruiter came to tell the assembled students: "After you finish medical school, every one of you except the two women will either be in the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or the Public Health Service." The last option, entering the Public Health Service, entailed assignment at the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control or the Indian Health Service. Those who were selected to serve at the NIH were known officially as clinical associates, but informally they were referred to as Yellow Berets. Whether the designation was born in jest or derision, it was intended as a foil to the Green Berets of the Army Special Forces. Fauci never liked the label because it implied an unwillingness to serve in harm's way. "As a physician," Fauci said, "I felt if I had to go [to Vietnam], I would gladly do my part to try to help." The competition for the limited number of Yellow Beret slots was so intense that only the best and brightest young physicians were selected. Fauci, the top graduate in his medical school class, was one of seven chosen from 140 applicants to train in his laboratory of interest. As described in my book "Medal Winners: How the Vietnam War Launched Med ical Careers," the class of Yellow Berets that entered with Fauci included four future Nobel laureates : Joseph Goldstein, Michael Brown, Harold Varmus and Robert Lefkowitz . Each new appointee completed two years of clinical training before arriving at the NIH. Their primary responsibility was learning how to conduct basic research under the guidance of a senior scientist. The second job was to care for patients at the NIH Clinical Center. Fauci and his fellow infectious disease colleagues also helped to care for wounded service members at the nearby National Naval Medical Center. Fauci, who had some research experience in medical school, trained at the NIH for three years under the tutelage of Sheldon Wolff - a pioneer in the relationship between the immune system and infectious diseases. Following a year of additional clinical training back in New York, Fauci returned to the NIH as a senior scientist conducting pioneering work, first on autoimmune conditions, then transitioning to study the newly emerging disease that would become known as AIDS. When he entered the clinical associate program, Fauci's ambition was to become a medical school professor. Had the Vietnam War not brought him to the NIH, Fauci probably would have remained in academia and the country never would have benefited from his extraordinary public service. Instead, from his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci has helped shape national policies related to HIV, bioterrorism and a series of pandemic threats including avian influenza, H1N1 (swine) influenza, Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is hard to imagine any other physician who has had such a sustained and profound impact on the health of our nation. While Fauci remained at the NIH for his entire professional career, most of his fellow Yellow Berets left Bethesda after their training was completed and headed for jobs at universities . Across the nation, the former Yellow Berets became medical school scientists, department chairs and deans. More than 60 former clinical associates, including Fauci, were elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, and he also was one of the more than 125 Yellow Beret alumni elected to the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine). In addition, Fauci was one of 10 alumni to receive the National Medal of Science. 

NIH-000168 For all the scars left by the Vietnam War, we should not overlook the fact that in its absence, SO years late r the country would probably not have Anthony Fauci guiding us through our current crisis. Dr. Fauci, we salute you and your fellow Yellow Berets.

Could we film Dr. Fauci exiting his house and going to the live truc k for Sunday morn ing inte rviews and then going back home or off to the WH. We would then match that in the film wit h the feed from the truck of him sit ting down and get archive from the shows he appears. We are close by.

The NIBIB comm unity has unique capacity to design, build , and deploy an array of power ful biomedical technolog ies. Much of our attention over the past year has been on early disease detect ion and prevention, and the integration of digital/pe rsonal health with conventional medicine . The COVID-19 crisis seems to have many challenges that are ideally matched for our capabilities . With the $60M NIBIB will receive in the supplement, we are in a unique posit ion to make a contribution. NIH-000188 

I am hoping we can meet with you to refine ideas and coordinate as we develop mechanisms to marshal these resources. Your insight will play an essential role in helping us move forward wisely. NIBIB has never received anything remotely like this before and we are in unfamiliar territory. I think it reflects, in part, the confidence---and hope, that people have in advanced technologies to change lives. We are determined to convert these dollars into tangible methods and devices and need your help in optimizing our strategy. I am forwarding my slide from the science presentation on Wednesday and my follow up email to Francis and Larry to give you a sense of our direction {apologies for the information blast!).

Dear Jon: Greetings from La Jolla. Congratulations on your interview w ith Tony Fauci. I have to admit that, until a couple of weeks ago, I have been quite critical of Tony's apparent acquiescence with so much dangerous, incorrect and politically motivated misinformation from the administration. I feared that the upside-down explanations from the administration had the effect of destroying the concepts and tenets of epidemiology and even rationalizing a completely wrong concept of communicable disease that holds that it is unnecessary to screen for carriers in an epidemic but only important to screen symptomatic people. That is upside-down from what we all know about dealing with epidemics and has even been endorsed by Trump, Pence and other members of the COVID-19 task force. It seems to have become a new normal concept of communicable disease management. Like so many things in the Trump era, facts and history are thrown out the window and replaced by governmentally espoused but obviously wrong concepts. We assume to be preparing to complete ly deny established concepts of communicable disease - screen only the prime suspects or the afflicted. In conversations with colleagues here I wondered "where is Tony Fauci?" They suggested that he must be quietly and heroically working hard being the scenes and at his personal peril to educate our leaders rather than correcting th em publicly. But I thought that, in desperate times, the public must hear and see clear truth and denials of lies. My concept of heroes are people who act at their personal peril - Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Martin Niemoller, Dietrich Bornhoffer, Thankfully, I th ink that the real Tony Fauci has emerged, obviously to his peril. I wish him good luck and survival. I find myself wondering what the responses will be to Trump 's likely premature lifting of isolation and quarantining procedures and if the concept of disobeying illegal and unethical orders will survive the times.

On Dec 6, 2018, at 1:19 PM, Friedmann, Theodore <t friedmann@ucsd.edu> wro te: Hello Jon - Greetings fro rrC: (b> c<1. It has been a long time since we last connected and talked about gene therapy, etc. and (b)(6) I was very interested to read George Church's troublesome responses in your interview with him in Science and to see his ethical evaluation of He's CCRS editing experiment in China. I'm not as generous to He as George seems to be and I think that th is work is clearly unethical. George inexplicably conjures up the sad history of Jess Gelsinger and the effect of his death on the evolut ion of the field of gene therapy. Happily, he's right about the fact that gene therapy is now proving itself in a growing list of intractable diseases (underscored by the 2015 Japan Prize). That has happened because stud ies are now much more carefully designed and carried out. But sadly, we are in an environment in which some people conclude that human medical man ipulations - gene therapy, genome editing, stem cell therapy- are ethical as long as they "work". The rationa le is, "let's do the study and if it works and doesn't kill or ot herwise harm, it's OK". It's not a post-factor evaluation that determines if an instance of human experimen tation is ethical and permissible - it is the design of a study that determines if it is ethical or not. George should be reminded of that fact and should re-read the Helsinki declarations or similar codes of human experimentation. In any event, your interview was fascinating.

I do not see Yazdan copied on your e-mail, andl so please forward this e-mail to him. The NIH position is that we should preferably make drugs available on randomized , controlled clinical trials and not freely distribute them. There is a strong push in the USA, favored by the President, to make certain of these drugs more widely available outside of an RCT using mechanisms such as "compassionate usage". In the USA, as you know, HC (plaquenil) is an approved drug for malaria as well as for certain autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Thus, physicians can prescribe the drug on an "off label" usage. This likely will be the majo r modality of distribut ion of this drug in the USA, at least for the foreseeable future. I am copying Cliff Lane on this e-mail.

NIH-000232 Hello, I am once again in service since the global sanitary crisis COVID-19 hit France a couple of weeks ago. I am now leading the Scientific Council for COVID-19, composed of 10 persons, serving the French President , Emmanuel Macron. The Council was created on March the 10th and we were heavily involved in advisory activities in relation to the President's decision to put the generalized quarantine into force, because we didn't have any better choice. Firstly We have a limited number of diagnosis tests, this prevents us from taking up a Korean-like strategy within the next few days. However, by the end of the quarantine (within the following six weeks), we will be able to have a generalisation of the diagnosis test and develop korean-like apps, as well as a strategy for testing and treatment if we have any drugs available by th is time. Before this, we will go through a difficult phase in the following weeks, because we won't have enough beds in our care units in some part of France ... Secondly On the therapeutic level, Yazdan Yazdanpanah has taken my place and who is now leading REACTing. Tomorrow morning a french-european medical trial will begin, under the control of the WHO, with 5 arms (placebo/kalatra/kalatra +interferon beta / product of Guilead / hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination for next week). As you may know, we are currently facing a press buzz since the announcement made by Dr. Raoult about the effectiveness of hydroxy-chloroquine. His data is not particularly convincing. We can dist inguish a slight positive signal but it must be confirmed by a well made randomised trial. We also started a monkey-model study with HC and we should have the results by the end of next week. Also a cohort of severe COVID+ patients have been created and some will be treated with HC : we will analyse those results with all the consciousness needed. It will also be possible to do a prevention trial for healthcare 

professionals and aging people with HC. I have an enormous political pressure to release HC and to give it to everyone but I am currently resisting ... How is the situation in the USA, especially after Trump's announcement ? What is the NIH position ? What will be put into force ? Thanks for your answer.

My name is Rita Apgar and if by chance you not iced my last name, as my father said many years ago,' (b) (6)!" I have lived in Italy for almost SO years and the sagacious finger of desti ny pointed my way to Italy, the true home of my heart , although not a drop of Italian blood flows through it. But the love of Italy and the Italians pumps throug h my heart every second of my existence . That sagacious finger of destiny pointed the way, and I followed it in faith to (b)(6) where I had lived. As soon as I set foot for t he first t ime in the house in this funky ghost town of a medieval village, I felt that we belonged together. And, practically speaking, at the t ime, it was the perfect solution to some weighty personal problems . Heart and mind were in peaceful agreement. I have a dear frie nd who is an infectious disease specialist at the hospital in Asti. She is, obv iously, extreme ly busy these days but she took the ti me to call me Sunday evening and we talked about you . She said to me, "you know, when I was j ust a graduate student, I was a secret group ie of Dr. Fauci, and once when he was at a meeting or a conferenc e or someth ing (I'm not sure whe re or when) I was able to ask him a few questions ." I was thri lled, of course, since I also try to watch every appearance you make on TV. I will not add anyth ing in this regard. NIH-000235 

But I did say to Mar ia, Doctor Maria Degioanni, "Maria, I want to invite Dr. Fauci to come and visit us for a few days when this crisis is over, God willing and maybe he would come together with (b)(6) . who has promised to come and visit again after 20 years. We can put them up in the fancy Relais San Damian above lsolalunga where I live and take them out to dinner at Gente di Mare . Dear Doctor Fauci, I like to joke when people ask how we are doing in this time of Covid-19 by saying : A Name, a guarantee : ISOLAlunga= ISOLAtion I Legend says that the Benedictine monks who got into mischief centuries ago were sent here as punishment to work in the olive groves: long isolatio n. Today it's the perfect place to be with a view of the Mediterranean as well as the Maritime Alps from the kitchen window and hardly a soul to practice social distancing with! Grazie per esistere as an Italian song goes, "thank you for being you! I would adore getting a reply from you, but realize how miraculous tha t woudl be! We would be over the moon if you accepted our invitation , at any time and at the drop of a hat! Sincerely, Rita Apgar NIH-000236

We provide assistance with activi ties of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, which keeps our clients in their homes and in the lowest risk setting. Our professional Caregivers are able and willing to continue to provide care to clients who test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to the virus. But we need your help so that home care companies do not face unreasonab le liability for providing such care. To that end, we ask for your support in getting a bill through congress like the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), 42 USC 247d-6d, that will insulate providers like us from claims related to the care we will be providing in these extraordinary times. We also ask that you support creating a fund that will provide appropriate personal protective equipment to our caregivers. Our clients should not have to bear the additional burden of the added cost of PPE. Additionally, we would like you to encourage the CDC to clarify its guidance on caring for COVID-19 patients (found here, here and here) that the guidance is applicable to "professional, licensed and insured, home based care agencies." This clarification will give the industry a workable standard to protect caregivers caring for COVID-19 clients. In essence, it would establish that facemasks and gloves are sufficient PPE to care for COVID-19 clients in the home, and not require its caregivers to comply with the healthcare setting requirements of wearing N95 respirators, eye protec tion (goggles or face shields) or gowns. This is important as a practical matter because respirators and gowns are not readily available at this time. Moreover, most home care workers are not tra ined in the proper use of respirators. Finally, we need your help in pressuring congress to provide day care for the children of our caregivers. If they cannot find adequate care for thei r children, then our clients will suffer. This is a vital step to keep our clients in the ir homes. NIH-000245 

With you help, home care companies will be able to: l. Relieve the burden on the healthcare system by keeping our clients out of the hospital; and 2. Adhere to shelter-in-place measures which w ill flatten the curve of COVID-19's spread.

ByKevin Cullen Globe Column ist,Updated March 23, 2020, 5:25 p.m. 209 NIH-000257 

Dr. Anthony Fauci's calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're fired.Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum. A quack, a snake oil salesman. He got his degrees on line, not from Holy Cross and Cornell. He watches Wheel of Fortune but not Jeopardy. He's a Yankees fan. Such character assassination is unsavory but necessary because Fauci's calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavi rus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're fi red. President Trump is watching and listening to the same thing we are, i.e., Fauci going to the podium to rebut with facts the latest outbreak of paranoid anxiety or the president'sr egu larly reckless statements. Fauci is an oasis of rigor and reason in a barren desert of confusion and fear. Which, given who he works for, makes him an endangered species. During the Vietnam War, some US Army officer supposedly suggested that in order to save a village from the Vietcong they had to destroy it. And so, to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy him - at least in Trump's eyes. Now that might sound crazy, but we're dealing with a crazy president in crazy circumstances. It's not as if there's no relevant precedent here. Two words: Bill Bratton. Two other words: Rudy Giuliani. Who happens to be Trump's BFF. Before Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the president's lawyer, he was the reform -minded mayor of New York City. Rudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His hand-picked sheriff was Dorchester's own Bill Bratton. As police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even more rema rkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor , so-called quality of life crimes that NIH-000258 

NIH-000259 had made New York less livable, from the tony sections of Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of Brooklyn. Bratton did his job too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled the worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor. This drove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound familiar? So Bratton had to go. That wasn't Bratton's first rodeo. Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of progressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest-ever Boston Police superintendent. Police Commissioner Joe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No. 2 so he busted Bratton. The point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small men make big mistakes. It may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New York Times. There used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover his or her career tanked. Similarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of death. Now, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it. He routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are mass-bought onto the newspaper's bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysyllabic words and prefers to get his news from "Fox & Friends" or whatever wh ite nat ional ist website his aide Stephen Miller might recommend. But Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a nuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo. We're way past the theoret ical here. Tony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest of us who expect - nay, pray for - one person in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis. So, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a bum. Long live the bum. Kevin Cullen is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at kevin .cullen@globe .com.

We're working on a story today about Trump's relationship with the scientific and medical experts in the coronavirus response, including Dr. Fauci. We're reporting this out today but wanted to send you what we've been hear ing as we get it so there's ample time to fact check everything today. Here are some points we'd love to discuss with the best person in your office or, better yet, Dr. Fauci himself . NIH-000263 

• Fauci was apoplectic about Trump's tweet yesterday saying the cure couldn' t be worse than the virus and indicating that he wants to reopen businesses soon. • Fauci has been forceful privately that unproven drugs should not be advertised to Americans as a panacea (and he of course has publicly spoken about these drugs). • We are also reporting in a separate story that Larry Ellison is building a website for the federal government that will collect data on the efficacy of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroqulne. our understanding Is Fauci is vehemently opposed to this idea and has pushed back on it, citing patient privacy concerns with the website and collecting data in this way outside of an approved FDA trial. Again, we'd love to speak with Dr. Fauci and any others in your office who may have insight into these particular issues and other aspects of the coronavirus response.

NIH-000271 Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great public servant in a time of great public need Fauci is the world's leading authority on infectious diseases and the best person in the country to help us deal with the COVID-19 crisis. David M. Rubenstein Opin ion contrib utor Some viewers of the daily White House coronav irus briefings may wonder why everyone increasingly defers to a diminutive, Brooklyn￾accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci. They do because , as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recently interviewing this man, he is without doubt the world's leading authority on infectious diseases. In any area of human activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci. So the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work￾around-the-clock, j ust-the-facts ma 'am style that he has used while serving under and working with six U.S . presidents. He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea ifhe is registered with any political party; I suspec t though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, provid ing the best health care treatment and info1mat ion possible, and saving lives. A top expert from AIDS to Ebola Tony Fauci joined the Na tional Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the Nat ional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 - 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period, he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria , 

NIH-000272 Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals , has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPF AR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More recently , he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S . through HIV antiretrov iral therapy targeted to disease hotspots. In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medical profession. For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before ass uming his current role), Tony has received, and earned, the Presidential Meda l of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many). With this long service and universa l acclaim, one migh t think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case, though. Selfless commitment to public service He is readily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need information. Tony still lives in the same hou se he bought when he first moved to Washington , and it is there that he and his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughte rs (thoug h none of them chose to attend medica l school). Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capito l Hill, he invariab ly turns down a car and driver for the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious reasons). The re are, of course, many other dedicated federa l servants who also view their comm itment to the country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federa l civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-term and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people. 

<image002.jpg > I tried years ago, when Tony was approac hing a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He quickly said no - money did not motivate him, serving the coun try did. And he stayed at NIH - to the country's good fo1tune. If there is any one medica l profess ional who can he lp the country deal with the COVID - 19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer. He is not a miracle worker. No one is. But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease prob lems and prescribe a trea tment that shou ld, in time , prov ide the requisite comfort , even if, in the short term, the medicine is painfu l and inconve nient.

While NIAID rightly has the lead in this effort for NIH, and is deeply invested in projects in both their intramural and extramural programs, it' s clear that a number of other ICs have creative ideas and a strong motivation to try to help with this global crisis. So this certainly seems like a time where we should gather (virtually of course) NIH-000277 

to brainstorm together, led by NIAID, and seek to identify any additional areas of contribution that could be subject to acceleration and/or collaboration. Hilary Marston recently convened a Deputies meeting on this subject, and I Cs were then asked to submit examples last Friday of projects they are pursuing in the COVID-19 space. Those were forwarded from Bob Eisinger to me. I have used those submissions, including a detailed list of NIAID projects, to put together a tentative agenda for Wednesday's meeting . That is attached. (b) (5) There are admittedly a lot of themes and topics here, so this will require some real discipline in the one-slide presentations . I will try to serve as time -keeper- or maybe I'll ask Larry to do that. □ D All IC Directors are invited to have one or two subject matter experts join them for this virtual discussion. Ashley Parker (b)(6) will be helping me with the logistics and will have further instructions about how the log in will work. Here's the specific follow up request that needs your immediate attention : 1. If your IC is pursuing a highly relevant project that's not listed here, and that you want the group to hear about, please send me that informa ti on ASAP. 2. If your IC is on the draft agenda to make a presentation, please submit your one slide (except for NIAID, who gets more) to me and Ashley by COB Tuesday 3/24. That way we can put the whole set together as a single ppt file. Many thanks! This should provide a welcome respite from the many other tasks we are all facing right now . Francis NIH-000278

In any area of human activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard . In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci. So the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work-around-the -clock, just-the-facts ma'am style that he has used while serving under and working with six U.S. presidents. He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and saving lives. A top expert from AIDS to Ebola Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 - 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period, he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria, Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More recently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots . In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of th e enti re medical profession. For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many). With th is long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case, though . Selfless commitment to public service 

NIH-000283 He is readily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though none of them chose to attend medical school). Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driver for the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious reasons). There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-term and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people. I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He quickly said no - money did not motivate him, serving the country did. And he stayed at NIH - to the country's good fortune. If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer. He is not a miracle worker. No one is. But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and prescribe a treatment that should, in time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the medicine is painful and inconvenient.

[ 161 However, favipiravir has not been shown to be effective in primary human airway cells, casting doubt on its efficacy in influenza treatment. [ 17] Approval status[edit] In 2014, Japan approved Fav ipirav ir for treating viral strains unresponsive to current antivirals.l 18l Toyama Chem ica l initially hoped that Avigan would become a new influenza drug that could replace Tamiflu. However , animal experiments show the potential for teratogenic effects on fetuses, and the approval of production by The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare was greatly delayed and the production condition is limited only in an emergency in JapanV 9l In March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration completed a Phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of Fa vipiravir in the treatment of influenza. [ 20] 

NIH-000296 On March 15, 2020 the drug was approved in China with the name Favilavir for the treatment of influenza .[ 2I] The drug was also approved for use in clinical trials for treating coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. [ 21] On 22 March, 2020 Italy has approved the drug for exper imental use against COVID-19 and has begun conducting trials in 3 regions most affected by the disease. [ 22l The Italian Pharmace utical Agency , however, has reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of this drug is scant and prel iminary.[23] Ebola virus trials[edit] Some research has been done suggesting that in mouse models Favipiravir may have efficacy against Ebo la. Its efficacy against Ebola in humans is unproven_[24][25][26] During the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak, it was reported that a French nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering for MSF in Liberia recovered after receiving a course of favipiravir. [ 27l A clinical h·ial investigating the use of favipiravir against Ebo la virus disease was started in Gueckedou, Guinea, during December 2014.(281 Preliminary results showed a decrease in mortality rate in patients with low-to-moderate levels of Ebola virus in the blood, but no effect on patients with high leve ls of the virus, a group at a higher risk of death.[ 29] The trial design has been critic ised by Scott Hammer and others for using only historica l conh·ols. [ 30] The results of this clinical trial were prese nted in February 2016 at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunist ic Infections (CROI) by Daouda Sissoko[3l] and published on March 1, 2016 in PLOS Medicine. [ 321 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[edit] On 17 March 2020, Chinese offic ials suggested that Favip iravir seemed to be effective in treating COVID-19 in Wuhan and Shenzhen_[33J[34][35] A study on 80 patients comparing it to lopinavir/ritonavir found that it significantly reduced viral clearance time to 4 days, compared to 11 for the control group, and that 91.43% of patients had improved CT scans with few side effects.P 6J[37] As of 23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issued an export ban on the substance . Japan and China are the only cotmtries in which favirapir is produced and approved as a med ical compound. Some Chinese pharmaceutical companies assure that export rights are still granted via interna tional diplomat ic means by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Informat ion Technology (MIIT).

The Chinese government has been conducting clinica l research on a treatment for COVID-19. ©AP ~fi n21 DALIA N, China -- An influenza medicine developed by a Fujifilm Holdings group member is effective against the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government said Tuesday. The government plans to officially recommend the drug's use for treatment. Fujifilm Toyoma Chemical developed favipiravir, sold under the brand Avigan. "It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment," said Zhang Xinmin, director of the science ministry's China National Center for Biotechnology Development, in a news conference. Fujifilm Toyoma Chemical developed the drug in 2014, and it has been provided to patients in Japan as treatment for the novel cornooavirus since February. Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical signed a patent-licensing agreement for favipiravir with Fujifilm in 2016. The drugmaker received clearance to produce the drug from Chinese authorities in February and can ramp up output of a generic version. The clinical trial was conducted at hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, with 200 patients participating. Test results for those receiving the drug turned negative in a shorter period, and their pneumonia symptoms improved at a higher rate. NIH-000306

As is the case for most answers, the most accurate is "it depends", but I realize that is not helpful in busy clinical settings: No symptoms - get test positive - can you work At this point in the pandemic, no. While we do not know what role asymptomatic infection may play in transmission and it is plausible that someone who is NOT coughing and sneezing (or any other respiratory droplet self-generating acts)is going to be less infectious than someone who is, persons known to be infected should self-isolate. This, of course, is particularly important for someone who has closed contact with someone at greater risk of severe illness and health care providers . Symptoms - test negative - can you work- or do you need 2 negatives - or the test has to be done 2-3-4 days after you develop symptoms Even before COVID-19, working while ill with a respiratory illness puts others at risk. Particularly during when flu activity is high. Not toughing it out and going into work while sick is more important now than ever and is an important component of social distancing-this is one of the founda tional ways that we distribute the impact of the pandemic over as long of a period as possible. (We are all gett ing good a drawing the two pandemic curves in the air on imaginary x￾and y-axes.). One of the critical areas where we need more data is on when someone who is infected becomes test-positive. Presumably, test-positivity would correla te wit h viral load in the respiratory tract and a + would indicate greater likelihood of infectiousness. But the real challenge of the return-to-work issue lies in your next question: Test posit ive - back to work when -do you need negative tests- or just time - ? 2 weeks after first symptoms, first test positive. Ah, there is the rub-currently, the recommendations vary-CDC has gone with 2 negative swabs 24 hours apart, but we do not believe that positivity during recovery necessarily proves infectiousness. This is a crucial question. We are reviewing the available data, examining at how PCR positivity, cycle threshold, and viral culture line up- the goal is to develop good, NIH-000635 

NIH-000636 clinical parameters to justify ending precautions, rather than requiring microbiological tests. A Get Out of Isolation Free card, if you will. The hypothesis we are testing to 2 weeks after onset and >72 hours without symptoms. Currently the published recommendations are not satisfying: https ://www.cdc .gov/co ronav i rus/2019 -nCoV / la b/guid eli nes-cli nica 1-speci mens. htm I I may have more information on this topic later today. Finally, in all complex epidemics, there is a tendency to search for a silver bullet-that one thing that will solve all of our problems. When an intervention is in short supply, the bullet turns platinum-"if only we could do x, the problem would be solved". This was vaccine in 2009 HlNl, naloxone in the opioid crisis, and now testing in coronavirus. Increased access to testing is desperately needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

No symptoms - get test positive - can you work Symptoms - test negative - can you work - or do you need 2 negatives - or the test has to be done 2-3- 4 days after you develop symptoms Test positive - back to work when - do you need negative tests - or just time - ? 2 weeks after f irst symptoms, first test positive .

In the coming weeks, an antibody test for COVID-19 should be available (I suspect). As 'survivors' are identified in the general population and are determined to be largely 'immune ' to COVID-19, I think those people should be given the opportunity to administer testing to others in the general population. The employment of VOLUNTEER survivors in the administration of tests would allow immune individuals to quickly learn how to collect samples and deal with potential infected patients face-to-face without fear of j eopardizing their own health or the health of the communities in which they live. This would free up highly trained nurses and doctors from testing and have an exponential benefit as survivors administer tests for infection and tests for antibodies and, thus, identify additional survivors. This would support more aggressive testing to bring about the eventual end of this virus when we try to identify every last infected individual who needs to be quarantined . Note: I understand we haven't yet determined whether survivors can be re-infected. So early volunteers may be subjected to further sickness. But the rate of re-infection should be less as a percentage than the rate of infection among the general population. And re-infection would likely be less severe. Note2: Creating a VOLUNTARY REIGSTRY of survivors (those wi th sufficient antibodies) may have a secondary benefit to businesses. It would allow businesses to quickly hire employees who could come in contact with the general public (thinking of current food delivery, grocery stores, daycare ... and later ... teachers, anyone in the medical or dental field, other retail businesses). I do understand my recommendations would generate HIPAA concerns but these are extraordinary times which call for out-of-the-box ideas ... and this would all be voluntary. Thank you for taking a couple of minutes to read this and thank you for managing a very diffic ult crisis. You and others on your team have saved a lot of lives and we are eternally grateful.

I have a recommendation as we move through this terrible time in the US as well as the world. To preserve the healthcare workforce why not give 25% of all health workers in the military the trial vaccine? Keep these workers away from patients until which time that the body can build immun ity . Let's not expose the entire medical workforce to the COVID-19. The idea is that this 25% can take care of the population (post-vaccine) without worry of getting ill and causing further spread of the disease. If there is possibility of the vaccine, trial age cohorts and demographics could play a crucial part in testing . Thank you for all you are doing to protect the health of our Nation.

From the first time I heard you say on a Sunday morning talk show, "If you th ink we are overacting then we are probably doing the right things ." I live in Maine and we are a rural state so we probably won't see the numbers that are elsewhere but we are listening and acting on your words of caution. NIH-000319

NIH-000325 From: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E] Sent: Mon, 23 Mar 2020 01:37:39 +0000 To: David Rubenstein Subject: FW: USA Today/David M . Rubenstein-- Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great public servant in a time of great public need David: You were so very kind to me in this article . Thank you so much. Warm regards, Tony Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great public servant in a time of great public need Fauci is the wo rld's leading authority on infectious diseases and the best person in the country to help us deal with the COVID-19 crisis. David M. Rubenstein Opinion contributor Some viewers of the daily White House coronavirus briefings may wonder why everyone increasingly defers to a diminut ive, Brooklyn -accented 79-year-old doctor, Tony Fauci. They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recent ly interviewing this man, he is without doubt the world's leading authority on infectious diseases. In any area of human activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci. So the American people - indeed, people around the globe - should be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work-around -the-clock, just-the -facts ma'am style that he has used while serving under and working with six U.S. presidents . He is as apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and saving lives. A top expert from AIDS to Ebola Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease since 1984 - 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be at the top of his game. But Tony is. During this period , he has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge - malaria, Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply running the institute and training dozens of the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS and, later, leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush's direction) the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other parts of the developing world. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More recently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots. 

In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medical profession. For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many). With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case, though. Selfless commitment to public service He is read ily accessible to those who need treatment - he still runs a lab at NIH - or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though none of them chose to attend medical school) . Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driver for the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious reasons). There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the country and its people over financial rewards . But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed Tony Fauci's long-term and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people. I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He quickly said no - money did not mot ivate him, serving the country did. And he stayed at NIH - to the country's good fortune. If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer. He is not a miracle worker. No one is. But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and prescribe a trea tment that should, in time, provide the requisite comfort, even if, in the short term, the medicine is painful and inconvenient .

Tony-- First of all, thank you for all you are doing to lead om country's respo nse during this cr isis. I hesitate to reach out to you with so much on your plate , but I think this idea might help with the national response. In light of the con tinuing cha llenge of engaging young p eople in social distancing measures , combined with the fact that so many colleges and univer sities are now teaching online, Georgetown's Globa l Health Initiati ve and Institute for Politics and Public Service are consideri ng a "vi11ual town hall" in which you could spea k directly with student s at co lleges and universitie s via Zoom ( or some other platform) about the collective challenge of COVID-19 and its risk to their health and to other members of their communities. This could be a unique forum for you, as the most trusted person in the public dialogue , to make the case directly to young people about their vital role in social distancing to flatten the curve in their communities. W/ e would use social media, of course, to push out key segments and messages from this event more broadly. While Georgetown would organi ze this "virtua l town ha ll", we would work closely with a network of more than 30 colleges and universitie s with which our Institute of Politics and Public Service regularly collaborates. We would also reach out to other schoo ls to ensure a geograp hic reach and a mix of public and private institutions. Of course, our team would work closely with your staff to manage all logistics so as to use your scarce time as efficiently as possible. Before we go any further in pl anning or thinking about this, I wanted to see if you would have time to participate or think this is a good idea. Be st! John John T. Monahan, JD NIH-000360

I am Dr. Jamuna R. Subramaniam. I did my Ph.D from Georgetown University and postdoc in Johns Hopkin s on neurodegenerative disease s. After returning to India I started working on biogenic amine neuortransmitters. One of the major trajectory of my research career was on an FDA approved , antihypertensive drug. Given the current scena rio of ACE2 being the receptor for Covid -19, and the widely used antihype1tensive dru gs also targe t the same. I thought of sensitiz ing you on a very effect ive antihypertensive drug, adelphane and adelphane esidrex made and sold by Novaritis This contains a historical VMA T - biogenic amines loading in synaptic vesicles, molecule , reserpine. Here, in India, a well known Nephrologist, has used this to treat a commun ity of close to 3000 patients for almost two decades. From him and others I have heard that it is a very effective, well tolerated antihype rtensive. Res erpine is a historical molecule that it had been used in the Indi an system of medicine, Ayurv eda. But ade lphane has the single specific purified molecule , reserpine, an alkaloid. Now Nova ritis has stopped making it. One of the reasons being given is reserpine's nega tive publicity when it was used an antipsycho tic drug. The reaso n given was a side effect of severe depression. We did a study on these patients on adelphane and find that it had not caused depression . Fmther, it seems to be retaining cognitio n in these patients. I could not pub lish these in big journals as you can understand. I am enclosing these two papers. NIH-000367 

As many lives are at stake, I thought I will sensitize you on this. Hope something good will come out of this. I am telling whomever I come across about the same. That is the best I can do. Hope the current scenario will show the living daylight for reserpine and helps the humanity. Thank you With regards Jamuna Dr. Jamun a R.

(I've included a slightly longer version with more references): N-acetyl cysteine for Coronavirus Robert Wiskocil, MD Affiliation: Private Practice Rheumato logy Date: March 19, 2020 Telephone Number: (b)(6) Email: (b)(6) Abbreviations: N-acety l cysteine (NAC), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) In a recent letter to Cell Research , Remdesivir and chloroquine were found to inhibit the SARS CoV-2 (COV ID-19) virus activity and replication in Vero cells (1 ). That study was the basis for current clinical trials involving those medicines . There might be a more cost-effective treatment for the Coronavirus. I believe it will be sensitive to oral high dose N-acetyl Cysteine A final common pathway to host destruction (autophagy) in infected cells in both Corona and Rota viral infections involves the Pl3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (2,3). This pathway is inhibited by "rapalogues " (like Rapamycin) where the NIH-000370 

NIH-000371 viral infection is stopped and the host cell survives. N-acetyl-cysteine, a potent anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor, alters the redox state of treated cells and can quench this same pathway (4,5). NAG (N-acetyl cysteine) has been used to rapidly clear Rotavirus diarrheal infections in children (6). Furthermore, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) coronavirus has been studied in Vero cells. In vitro, NAG blocks that particular virus (7), and in vivo, NAG blocks intestinal damage caused by this virus (8). NAG likely provides a "redox clamp" on the autophagy pathway this virus exploits. Since the PEDV coronavirus is effectively blocked in Vero cells by NAC, the SARS-GoV-2 (COVID-19) will likely also be inhibited. This test should be done, and if positive, clinical trials ought to follow. Doses of 2.4-3.5 g/d of NAC have been used to treat patients with Lupus (4). That dose is well tolerated and inexpensive . If NAC were effective in symptomatic patients, it could add a cost-effective measure of protection to healthcare workers and exposed individuals . References: 1) Wang , M., Cao, R., Zhang, L. et al.

Abstract Background No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV￾2. Methods We conduc te d a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir - ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordina l scale or discharge from the hospital, wh ichever came first. Results A tot al of 199 patients with laboratory-confirm ed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard -care group . Treatment with lopinavir - ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.90 to 1.72). NIH-000397 

Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir - ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference , - 5.8 percent age points; 95% Cl, - 17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar . In a modified intention-to -treat analysis, lopinavi r- ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day tha n that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% Cl, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinav ir- ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard -care group. Lopinavir- ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. Conclusions In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonav i!J t reatment beyond standard care. Future tr ials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit .

I typed the orig inal message on phone. I just noticed a bunch of typos. Below is a better version. Regards, Erik Dear Dr. Fauci, You're beyond busy but I hope you read this message. (b) (4) I'm only mentioning this so you don't think I'm a paranoid freak. I'm convinced you already know the outbreak is way past the point of containment, and, unfortunately, herd immunity will soon ensue. Then, outbreak 2 will happen shortly after, and, hopefully, not ad infinitum. I'm writing to make sure you already know or at least suspect everything I'm about to tell you. I need to clear my conscience NIH-000405 

because it's possible (albeit unlikely) that some of what tell you is new and possibly useful in, at least, saving lives in the USA. I'm a physicist and have been modeling this outbreak since January. My panic started minutes after I learned tvSM people left Wuhan around January 22 a few days before the CCP starting locking the country down. The SM peop le scattered to 13,000+ cities in China to visit family & friends for the Lunar Festival (Chinese New Year). I 've been communicating with quite a few people around the world including an NYU epidemiologist (b)(6) . We've both been warning our families, to mostly deaf ears at first, since January. It's been frustrating and exhausting, but, finally, most are as prepared as possible for what's about to happen. I have lots of information about China due to my business, scientif ic, friendship, and other ties with many there, including immunologists & virologists at top-tier institutions and laboratories . My WeChat account (like Skype / Whatapp) was blocked by the CCP for 3 days late February / early March, but, after a warning message, it is now unblocked . I'm willing to share with you everything I know, think I know, or seriously suspect. Here are a few examples: I'm confident t hat China stop counting dead COVID-19 infected bodies since tvJanuary 7, 2020. They'v e been add ing fabricated data daily to show (to save face) the world and their own people an impressive flattening of China outbreak curve . It's easy to prove this via data analysis because, for example, improbable coincidences occurred in much of the data. My suspicions were eventually confirmed by at least two of my sources in China (b)(6) ------------------ ). The data posted by Chin a is not only garbage, it has mis led the world into a false sense of security wrt death rate, age vs death, and other things; that is, if people analyzed the world's data including China, the NIH-000406 

NIH-000407 results are heavily biased towards nonsense, because China's number of cases accounted for the majority of cases worldwide (until a day or so ago). I want to emphasize that I do not believe China intentionally did this to harm the world. I sincerely believe it was done for saving￾face reasons. Saving face is possibly the most powerful motivating force in China. it is the key to understanding how most Chinese think and why they do what they do. China wanted the world to believe that their Herculean quarantining efforts contained the outbreak . However, I don't think this is true, even after spraying ~billions of gallon of "Clorox" all the country. The number of body bags my contacts told me about about, even after short 15-minutes walk to/from grocery stores in one city during CCP-authorized time slots, suggest the number of deaths is several orders of magnitude larger than what China's posted data indicates . Also, everyone I know in China continues to be in lock down ( ~6+ weeks now), and several went "silent" since about a week ago. This greatly troubles me because those who went silent live in Wuhan. And, yesterday, the CCP revoked permits/license for several Foreign reporters who were trying to learn about about the situation in Wuhan and other parts of China. Several of my sources have told me, in coded language, that the situation in at least Wuhan is not under control at all. In my opinion, China is continues to be extremely concerned about saving face (first) and their economy (second). Their economy is already suffering terribly, and they can't afford to lose the many large manufacturing and other business agreements with foreign countries . This is why I believe they're trying, and succeeding to convince many, to convince most of their population that the outbreak is under control, and it will soon be ok to return to work -- even though it will not be safe, because of current outbreak and outbreak # 2 that will likely start soon. Citizens are not allowed to travel beyond a few stores and, in special cases, their work office, so even people who live their have no idea what's really going on especially in Hubei province including Wuhan. Also, an H 15N outbreak seems to have recently started in 

NIH-000408 humans in Hunan province (which neighbors Hubei/Wuhan area) . I also have lots of information about USA. Here is some: I believe that many COVID-19 deaths were incorrectly labelled at 2019-2020 flu deaths. The spreading in the USA is almost certainly already homogeneous, because it's been going on since last year without any containment whatsoever. Once massive testing finally starts, this truth/reality will, unfortunately, become obvious. It will manifest itself as hyper exponential (hyperbolic) growth starting a day or two after the millions of testing kits arrive and start being used . The hyper exponential dynamics will eventually evolve to a more accurately calibrated exponential curve once the number to tests is large enough to properly sample the population. I don't think Italy is ahead of us. I think we're ahead and by a large amount. A few other quick bits of info ... The time between infection and death seems to have decreased from about ~20 days (a few months) ago to possibly as short as ~8 days. And, the incubation period seems to be significantly longer. Both, and other data I've looked at, strongly suggest at least one mutation has occurred. This is extremely concerning to me. Another concern is the distribution of deaths vs. age appears to not be as strongly biased, compared to when China data was included, towards older people and/or people with chronic health conditions. Over the past 15+ years, I've traveled to China multiple times per year. I'm pretty sure you've known this for a while, but I truly believe the outbreak tsunmai in the USA is either already happened or is about to happen. As you know, as soon as a surge is sensed, the Tsunami will immediately follow. I believe we missed the containment boat quite a while ago. I've been 

closely listening to your comments on TV, and I'm pretty sure you've already come to the same conclusion but don't want to cause mass panic (I understand that). I'm 99% sure that SARS-CoV-2 been spreading in the USA since late November / earl v December last year. (b)(6) (b)(6) (b)(6) She works at (b)( 6) and --- it's possible that everyone in her office got infected too. Who knows how many people in Alaska got it too, but I suspect many tens of thousands possible much more. CbH6) but it has been impossible to get tested. I've called 5 places in Alaska and none wanted me to come it for the test. I've instructed my family and, recently (after family), close friends to get some Alvesco ( ciclesonide) for emergency use only. I've been told by colleagues on the front-line in Japan, China, and Korea, and found several pre-pr int papers, that it is an effective treatment for late-stage COVID-19 patients. Some patients on ventilators who were approaching death have fully recovered after treatment with ciclesonide; ciclesonide has much smaller particles than other corticosteroids so it reaches deeper into lungs and alveolis) . Also, the treatment seems to be a potent suppressor of virus replication. Recovered patients have tested negative shortly after the treatment. Of course, data is limited so can't be sure the treatment is effective. However, because Alvesco has been shown to be safe for infant - 100+ year-old patients, I'm ok with my family and I having it for emergency use. That is, only if healthcare facilities are unable to accept them or me as a patient to treat with ventilator, NIH-000409 

NIH-000410 corticosteroids ( or whatever the best available treatment is at that time). Having Alvesco in our emergency kits is a much better option that someone avoidably dying because of an overburdened healthcare facility. The other drug I have, and have told my family and some friends to get, is called hyro xychloriquine -- also seem to be effective and safe. But , I think Alvesco is better because it appears to prevent the virus from replicated so infection is wiped out and no longer contagious. Alvesco seems to be two silver bullets in one. I don't believe in coincidences and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but there are many things out of Iran that also concern me greatly . That's all I say right now. If all of this is old news to you, then I would greatly appreciate a response. It can be as short as "yes". Anyway, I had to share this information with you. Now my conscience is clear . My concern is that it's possible you don't have some of the above info, so I decided to send you this message . I wrote this quickly, so I apologize in advance for any typos, etc . I truly appreciated your efforts, and I'm now confident that President Trump, you, and everyone else involved is doing everything possible to ensure the best possible outcomes. I was deeply concerned a few weeks ago, when the gravity of the situation seemed to not be fully recognized by several in DC. Feel free to call me anytime. My cell # is below. If you do call, I will keep anything we discuss confidential (if necessary) .

I Don't know who to go to that can help imp lement this and want your input if you think this is a viable aid, then maybe you can help me reach the right people to make the biggest impact, maybe even up to the Coronavirus team in the White House. I have (b) (6) & when I first heard about China quarantin ing 43 million peop le I got worried about masks, I looked up how to sew a mask for myself & family. I found a site that talked about sewing masks for cancer treatment patients and to use 100% quilters cotton for outside & 100% flannel cotton on inside. I started sewing several. I know they aren't the N95, but they are bette r than nothing IF needed. My Dr just told me yesterday not to go anywhere without a mask because it's too much of a risk for my health . It got me thinking. What if while people across the country were in home quarantine, ALL those who know how to sew, they sew these masks to donate in their communities. Not for use against Coronavi rus, but for other things normal masks are used (food prep, non-sickness medical reasons, etc) then they aren't using up the valuab le higher rated masks that are needed for doctors, nurses & first responders fighting Coronavirus . These masks can also be washed as needed again and again which will just keep saving other masks. During the WH Press Release this morning, Seema expresses the need for masks & Dr Birx explained how the virus is being spread from surfaces, but that it can't survive in fabric . Which means maybe these cloth masks will even help against the spread of the virus. Either way, if you can help ok for these to be used in some manner vs a medical mask being used w ill help pro long the need for more masks and hopefully 3M can have more made by then so we never have to experience an lack of masks.

We're clearly not there yet, but are further along with your efforts. I'm not sure whom to contact about this, and so am writing you because I'm confidant you can get it to the right hands. With regards to the recent closures to Europe and so many Americans coming home, I was at first heartened to hear that all Americans returning would be medically screened and encouraged to/made to quarantine for 14 days. However, I was then disheartened to learn that that hasn't been the case, at least through this past Saturday. (b)(6) was on business in Amsterdam last week and rushed home last Thursday after hearing on Wednesday evening about President Trump's Friday midnight shutdown . He came in through LAX from Amsterdam, and wasn't asked any medical questions, nor was he asked to quarantine. Then a friend came in through Miami from Paris on Saturday, and was only given a short medical form to fill out, and then let go. No med ical check, no temperature screening, no further questions. From touchdown to taxi (plus picking up bags), 45 minutes total. Having lived in Singapore through SARS, I'm deeply disturbed. We had medical/temperature checks at all airports, and mandatory quarantines for anyone with possible contact with a SARS contact/patient . The virus was quickly and efficiently contained, and the same has been done in Singapore to date with Covid 19. I was heartened last Friday as I learned that the federal government was on board, and hearing about significant measures that would be taken soon. I must say I've been disheartened as of today, with not enough tests, mask, respirators and ventilators in place. And then hearing of the lack of medical screenings at airports. Please help, as I know you've so desperately been trying to do. And please help to stem any incorrect information going out from our President, information which NIH-00042 1 

NIH-000422 gives us hope for a couple of days, and then dashes that and puts many into a frenzied despair. We can cope with what's happening, and will continue to change our behavior per the guidelines , but only with information that's accurate.

I can send you my resume so you can see my skills and abilities that I can bring to the table. Am currently in nursing school ( R.N. ) in Rego Park, Queens with a (b)(6) .._ _________ -=-:,~ My school (----=- .-- ,-.-- , .......,,..._..----..---..--. (b) (6)) has recieved a request from New York Governor Cuomo's office looking for nursing students to help volunteer. However many students like myself are very hesitant to volunteer for the simple fact that it will interfere with our studies and we will still have to comply with class assignments and class exams and especially with final exams this current semester coming up at the middle to end of April 2020. Yet many of my fellow classmates would love a chance to stand up and deliver help during these trying times . However our school will not except any excuses for lateness or absence even though we are now on an online learning as of this moment. So our greatest fear is that we wont finish this semester and will not be able to start next semester ( it starts April 28, 2020 for our school ) ... basically 2 semesters wasted and it will push back our graduation date and furthermore incur more student loans in order to continue with school. This is why I am writing to your office if an exception can be made and we can have OT J ( on the job training for nursing) and recieve credit and for our current semester and possibly our next semester. Many of the students I speak about already have a Bachelor's degree ( I myself have a B.S. In Biology from (b) < ) and many are or have worked as Nurse aides in many NYC area local hospitals with many years of excellent experience. Imagine if you are able to approve this for many nursing school students in just the New York City area and Long Island Suburbs .This would be virtually an untapped experienced workforce of literally hundreds perhaps maybe thousands of hands on personnel ready to go to help relieve the over burdened health system workers and provide additional reinforcements due to the coronavirus. In not only my area of New York city but possibly all over the country where we can help providing help and additional assistance and reinforcemen ts Dr. Fauci, I am humbly asking for special permission, we all will need all the help we can get. Please consider this option as this can be a win/ win situation for not only NYC residents but for other areas of the country hit hard by this crisis . I have spoken to many of my fellow classmates and they all understand the risk and would be willing to share the burden with the NIH-000423 

extreme pressures put on the health care system at this time. Many of us including myself would be w illing to work on site or what ever site you may need us the most, many us fully understand that we could potentially be away from our families for an extensive unknown period of time which we are ready for and prepared for or possibly put our health on the line too. I implore you to give us a chance and only ask for special permission for OT J in order to fully finish our R.N. nursing degree. Thank you for your time in reading this letter. You are doing one fine heck of job in providing outstanding information and keeping the public informed Sincerely , Ivan Bocardo Personal Cell phone ____ (b_ )_(_. 6) NIH-000424

Good facts such as the number of actual patients is very small compared to the whole population, most people who get it make a full and complete recovery. Are you enjoying the senseless panic you made? Panic where people are hoarding food/goods , stealing full shopping carts from the elderly, losing their jobs/wages, inadequate education now that schools are closed. The number of people who will actually be sickened by the virus will be dramatically dwarfed by the people who lose their jobs, receive a poor education despite the ir teachers best efforts and miss out on once in a lifetime events such as weddings, graduations, communions.

My friend and I would like to make a fabric face mask pattern available at no charge so that quilters, sewers, and crafters can make face masks. We understand these are nowhere near medical grade, but they would be better than nothing at all. {See research cited in link above .) They would be made from fabric scraps and supplies on hand; no trips to the fabric store would be necessary. At this time there are no masks available to the public at all. Sewing for a cause would give purpose to those of us staying home . Wearing a mask on rare occasions when we do venture outside has the benefits signaling others to step back even if the masks do not protect against transmission of the virus . NIH-000440 

We are just two individuals wanting to help. I've been advised by an attorney that sharing this free pattern might open us up to scrutiny from regulatory agencies or possible law suits. We don't want to step on any toes, nor do we want any legal entanglements . Could the NIH make t his pattern available? Or the CDC? There are millions of sewers who would be delighted to step up and help right now. It would be great for morale , and even t hough it's one step up from nothing , IT IS SOMETHING. This could even be scaled beyond indiv iduals making fabric face masks for th emselves. Masks could be sewn for ot hers. Could we please work with you? Thank you for your consideration , Ami Simms (b)(6)and Emanuela D' Amico (b)(6) NIH-00044 1

After death s from the virus reached more than 2,500, with a 150% increase in the past week, health authorities have been combing through data to provide clues to help combat the spread of the disease. NIH-000445 

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government is evaluating whether to extend a nationwide lockdown beyond the beginning of April, daily La Stampa reported Wednesday. Italy has more than 31,500 confirmed cases of the illness. Italy Coronavirus Deaths By prior illnesses(%) 0.8 No other illness 7 25.1 1 other illness- - 48 .5 --3 or more illnesses 25 .6 2 other illnesses-- Source: ISS Italy National Health Institute, March 17 sample The new study could provide insight into why Italy's death rate, at about 8% of total infected people, is higher than in other countries. The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country 's coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or o .8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The average age of those who've died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of March 17, 17 people under so had died from the disease. All of Italy's victims und er 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions. While data released Tuesday point to a slowdown in the increase of cases, with a 12.6% rise, a separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real number of cases by testing only patients present ing symptoms. NIH-000446 

NIH-000447 According to the GIMBE Foundation, about 100,000 Italians have contracted the virus, daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. That would bring back the country's death rate closer to th e global average of about 2%. - With assistance by Karl Maier

Many Americans are hanging on your every word, as they should be, and that includes me. A question about COVID-19 mechanism of spread: The reported reproductive number from China of about 2.6 indicates a likelihood of large droplet spread as the mode of transmiss ion from person to person . My question is - could there be a component of airborne spread (droplet nuclei) with this virus? If super spreaders exist with COVI D-19, is airborne spread possible? Knowing the answer to th is question would help to inform decisions about PPE and Decontamination in settings such as Emergency Departments . If this is not already known definitively, could NIOSH and some key partners possibly study it in current quarantine settings? Thanks, Tony . God bless you and you r important work!

Though your workload is unimaginable. I thought you might personal ly know and could provide contact information of an appropriate CDC or NIH epidemio logist. ***Brief Summary of Concept***skip to End, if obvio us*** Had I been to a doctor or ER with a virulent disease, they would immediately have asked where I had been, with whom, and for what duration . With that information, epidem iolog ists can notify and test those contacts ... and their contacts ... before their symptoms are eviden ced. This manual contact tracking process is workload intensive, calendar -day wasting, data-poor, and inaccurate . "Location tracking" can provide the raw data needed to identify potential contacts automatically , early, and thorough ly, from information routinely collected by network providers. The location , at a date and time, of a vast number of anonymo us cell phones , over the preceding two weeks, would be very useful for identifying the index case and subsequent contacts of an individual. As an illustration , the New York Times published , on 19 December 2019. "Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset , Zero Privacy" about the commercial location tracking industry : https://www .nytimes.com/interactive/20 19/12/19/op inion/location-trackinq-cell-phone . html ***End of Summary*** Ignoring the techie and legal detai ls. can you suggest an appropriate contact, whi le Covid-19 infections in the United States are few?

Analyze how eliminating the global health security team has put us several steps behind where we need to be in figh ting coronavirus ; and 3.

Dr. Zhang is the Director of the Infectious Disease Department of Huashan Hospita l in Shanghai. He is very good according to my observation all long. Another great doctor in China is Dr. Nanshan Zhong. According to Dr. Zhang's video at https://www. thepaper.cn/newsDeta il forward 6537248, COVID-19 can really be prevented with 3 key measures, i.e. to keep social distancing , wash hands frequently and wear masks. I strongly suggest American people should wear masks like Chinese, Soutl1 Korean people, etc., because even China 's highest leader, Mr. Jinping Xi, wears masks. If it is difficul t for all the US people to do this now, I suggest working staff in airports, supern1arkets and other public places should wear masks firstly in order to avoid crossing infection. Further, Dr. Zhang said, if a person is still infected though he/she takes the above 3 measures carefully, the person must be infected by his/her family members. So I propose the concentrated isolation of mild confirmed cases should be considered as I advised yesterday. I strongly suggest American government should learn precious experience of anti-COVID-19 from and cooperate with the mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea with an open mind. If you need any help to contact with Dr. Zhang, I will do what I can. I am very confident that the US government will lead American people to win the anti-COVID￾19 war by you and other great experts.

I have been following spread of COVID-19 (Corona Vims) closely because such virns is very contagious and dangerous. If a person is mildly sick with COVID-19 , the CDC now suggests the person should "stay home except to get medical care", i.e. home-isol ation, according to https://www.cdc.gov /coronav irus/2019-ncov /downloads/slck-with- 2019-nCoV-fact- sheet.pdf However, the home isolation may result in family spread of COVID-19 in certain kinds of families, e.g., parents are infected but their kids are too young to take care of them, adults are infected but their parents are too old and risky to look after them (if they live together) , an old husband /wife is infected but the spouse is too vulnerable to take care of him/her, etc. In such scenarios, the home isolation may increase family spread and even community spread risks in the us. A great method to avoid home-isolation risks is the concentrated isolation, i.e. to isolate mild symptomatic people in a concentrated place instead of thefr homes. The concentrated isolation can avoid the above family spread risks, provide professional medical help to isolated people, reduce menta l pressure of other family members, etc., so that it can reduce community spread risks. Such method has been proved to be effective by China's war against COVID- 19. The concentrated place can be a hotel, university dorm building, etc., which should be easily managed for medica l surveillance. NIH-000466 

NIH-000467 The concentration isolation may be voluntarily chosen by relevant families at the beginning, and adjusted to apply subject to different conditions. Hope the above advice helpful! Best regards, Michael Liu

From: Monticone, Giulia (b)(6)> Sent: Monday, March 16, 2020 7:00 PM To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E]-------=- (b)c-c(= > Subject: COVID19 emergency Dear Dr. Fauci, I am a postdoc researcher working at LSU health sciences center In New Orleans. I would like to communicate my concern about the COVID19 in the US. I am Italian and my partner is Chinese and we have been carefully following the COVID19 spread first in China and now in Italy and Europe. Based on my scientific and personal knowledge I am confident to say that the US is only few weeks ahead of What is happening in Italy now and this could only be stopped if strict measures will be taken in the enti re country as soon as possible. If you have the power , I ask you to please try to convince the government to apply such measures, even if this means to shut down the entire country for some weeks. I know that the economy and money interests are what often prevents to take such decision, but in this case we are ta lking about life and death and we cannot risk this high price. We have a very clear example of how severe the COVID19 can be if we do not act on t ime and th is is unfortunately my country at this time. We also have a good example, China, in which very aggressive measures have been applied and, despite some delay in their application at first, they now have reached a strong regression in the virus spread and they gradually can restart the country. China measures were to close every city borders, close working places and every non essential activity. They asked the population to stay at home and go out only for food and health emergencies. I think th is is what we should do in US too. A recent study from Italy in which they tested every person in one Italian city showed that the 50-70% of the peop le positive for the virus were asymptomat ic. This is such an impor tant information that tells us the only way to prevent the spread is to prevent the people from moving because we cannot really know who is caring the virus. Also, screening is important and should be ideally extended to everyone. http s:// www .repubblica.it/salut e/ medicina-e￾ricerca/ 2020/03/16/n ews/ coronavirus studio ii 50- 75 dei casi a vo sono asintomat ici e molto contagiosi-251474302/ NIH-000475 

NIH-000476 My lab is based in New Orleans where the number of COVID19 cases is now growing fast. However, there is no sign from the university or my institute to close. We are working as usual with only some mild restrictions even if we have colleagues that are at home sick, or worse, that showed up at work coughing. The city mayor applied some restrictions but the people are still celebrating events on the street. Up to today we were acknowledged that we have a presumptive positive case in the building where we live. We are doing what we can as responsible individuals but tomorrow we will go to work again not knowing if we are spreading the virus. I thank you for reading this email and I hope my arguments are solid and accurate enough to encourage you to take action. Best wishes, Giulia

Currently hospitals in New York City are asking their healthcare providers to wear surgical mask while t reating COVID￾19 COVID-19 is highly contagious in healthcare settings with a large proportion of healthcare professionals being infected reported in early literature [1]. A recent study suggested that asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 which puts potentially additional threats to healthcare providers [2]. Although surgical mask can effectively prevent droplet transm ission, whether and to what degree SARS-CoV-2 can transmit through aerosol approach is still uncerta in. Studies with 2003 SARS virus suggest a high level of concerns for aerosol transmission [3], and a recent unpublished study from MedRxiv revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has similar aerosol stability compared to SARS [4). Healthcare professionals are our frontline force against the coronav irus emergency and we cannot afford even a slight probability of a large scale infect ions among healthcare workers due to insufficient personal protective equipment. We hope that accessing the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and any potential mass production program are actively being considered to protect, and ultimately, save lives for U.S. people.

Hi Tony, Thank you so much for calling me this morning, and for your terrific help last night trying to think through the issue (b)(4), (b)(6) Given our discussion this morning, I think it would be very helpful if the task force on coronavirus came up with a clear algorithm for addressing issues related to people having symptoms that could be from a cold, flu, or other virus - and not related to the virus that causes COVID-19. Let's say there's a hypothetical patient with some combination of sore throat, aches and pain, low grade fever in the 99's by mouth, and cough; there's no shortness of breath. let's say they are now proactively self-quarantined at home and are in the process of evaluation. Questions include : 1. Who, if any, of the person's contacts within the previous days should be contacted? 2. If it's only "close contacts" - those who were within 6 feet of the person for an extended period of time: a. What's the definition of extended period of time? b. Does any physical touch ing- such as a hug or handshake - immediately mean there is significant contact? c. How far back from the onset of the person's illness do we need to check for "close contacts?" This gets to the issue of how long before symptoms begin can asymptomatic shedding occur. 3. If no Covid-19 test ing is available or the person has been told they are not sick enough for testing: how do we think about the potential risk to that person's contacts, for example, at home or work? NIH-000485 

4. If Covid-19 testing is available: before the result is back, what is the advice for a corporation or other entity where the person being tested may have infected others through asymptomatic shedding of virus? Should the possible exposure, even if relatively "low risk", set off any protocol that deals with trying to minimize possible spread of the virus? Thanks!

This will indefinitely postpone our budget hearing. Thanks for your patience, Adrienne Dear Agency Legislative Affairs Teams: Due to the full Administration mobil ization underway, we are placing a temporary hold on sending up government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response. The Executive Branch needs all of its resources directly focused on executing its day-to-day respo nse to coronavirus. We will continue to practice "radical transparency" with Congress NIH-000490 

NIH-000491 and the American people, but participation in hearings cannot continue to divert resources from our response effort. This pause is effective immediately. It is intended to last for three weeks, through the end of March, though we will reevaluate if it needs to be extended at a later date . Importantly, as noted above, this does not only include witnesses for hearings that are explicitly focused on coronavirus, but also, to be determined on a case-by-case basis, witnesses and agencies who are playing vital roles on the Task Force or the broader Administration response, whether or not the hearing topic is coronavirus . Therefore, please do not accept hearing invitations from Congress for hearings through March if you believe they meet the above criteria . If you already have hearings confi rmed that you believe fits th is criteria, please notify us immed iately. You will likely have to postpone those hearings. Four corners leadership offices have already been notified of this policy. Please reach out to 0MB if you have any questions, and we will be happy to work with you as we implement this policy. Thank you.

Fauci , MD, Head of NIAID From: Walter Tengelsen , Chmn. of MACROSYSTEMS INST. First,, allow me to thank and congratulate you for telling the government, and the press, about our nation's unpreparedness for the coronavirus spread. But while we wa it for Big Pharma to develop a vaccine for this disease, there is some thing that could be done NOW to prevent the spread of the virus ... and it wouldn't cost the gove rnment anything! Allow me to explain. Decades ago, when I was a designer in Aerospace , and took my drawing s up to the blueprint room for copies, I would always notice the 'aroma' of ammonia in the room. Inquiring about the safety of this constant exposure by the blueprinting staff I was told that there are three groups of people who don't get co lds: 1) those work ing in salt mines, 2) those workin g in sewe rs, and 3) tho se working in blueprint rooms! A few decades later I was advised, by an MD, that the way to avoid colds is to keep saucers of household ammonia in my house rooms ( and in the office rooms , if allowed), and that one would not even notice the smell after a few days. Since cold virus transmission is by aerosol particles from the already -in fected, and the dilute ammonia fumes are able to NIH-000492 

'inactivate' them, might these ammonia fumes be able to protect us against the coronavirus? Admitted ly, too much ammonia gas can be very irritating (and even fatal, as in WW!), but evidently people seem to survive and thrive at the just-noticeab le gas levels being recommended here . If there is some potential lung damage from ammonia gas, that might be prevented by taking (freeze-dried) stinging nettles leaf, a widely recognized lung-cleaning supplement that is recommended by Naturopathic Doctors. But it would seem that the potentia l benefits of limiting the spread of the coronavirus in our entire population far outweighs the risks of lung damage . Since most homes already have bottles of anunonia (in their laundry area), this preventive strategy could be impl emented immediately, and would provide the public with the satisfaction of feeling they are doing 'their part' in combatting this pandemic ... and protecting themselves and their loved-ones. NOTE: I am NOT a medical doctor, but an electron ic systems enginee r and scientist ( who takes systems engineering as a license to meddle in all things), but I was the first male family member in 4 generations who did NOT become a pham1acist or physician.

I know you have every expert on earth working on this virus. I am watching the attempts to slow the transmission and "flatten the CUJve." What if we could reduce the fatality rate? Wouldn't that be huge and assist in reducing the panic ? I am hearing that hosp itals are going to be short on respirators and that the virus attacks the lungs. My idea - might help people to breat h more efficien tly . Summary: Here is my idea: Doctors need to utilize methods that endurance athletes have used in the past to increase their red blood cells in order to increase their body's blood-o xygen carrying capacity. Further description: Athletes like Lance Armstrong used blood doping and other ways to increase the ir Erythropo ietin (EPO). This was called cheating in sports. Howeve r, the results gave him an advan tage because his body could get more (V0-2 max) oxygen with a single breath compa red to others. This helped Armstro ng to become more "supe r human ." I agree that this should be illegal in sports. However, I think it wou ld be great if a person was fighting for their life to be super human. NIH-000499 

There are natural ways to increase your EPO and there are drugs to trick your body into producing more EPO. One of the best natural ways is high altitude training (think Boulder, CO and Kenya marathon runners). Also, the risks involved in increased red blood cell count obviously include stroke, blood clot, heart attack and many others. But I think that if monitored closely and as a last resort this method might help some people to survive this outbreak. Sincerely , Patrick Hackenberry From (b)(6) (b) (6) cell I have NO connections to the website(s) or companies below: Reference the article below from www.harnmemu trition.c om By: William Misner, Ph.D. From 1996 until his retirement in 2006, Dr. Bill worked full-time as Director of Research & Development at Hammer Nutrition. Among his many accomplishments, both academically and athletically , he is an AAMA Board Certified Alternative Medicine Practi tioner and the author of "What Should I Eat? A Food-Endowed Prescription For Well Being". - Dr Bill's Full Bio What is EPO? Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells (RBC). Erytbropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone produced in the kidneys, containing a 165-amino acids structure. Most erythropoietin is produced by the kidney's renal cortex, but some is also produced in the liver (mainly in the fetus), the brain and uterus. Why is it important? Erythropoietin production is stimulated by low oxygen levels in interst itial cells of the peritubular capillaries in the kidneys. Following its production in the kidneys, EPO travels to the bone marrow where it stimulates production ofred blood cells NIH-000500 

NIH-000501 (RBC's) [2]. EPO increases the body's blood-oxygen carrying capacity, but only up to a point. An overabundance may comprom ise health and hinder blood flow dynamics with performance-limiting implications . In the absence ofEP O, only a few RBC's are formed by the bone marrow. Why are RBC's important? Red blood cells carry iron-rich hemoglobin for up to 120-days, then they die. Unless there is a continual supply of Iron, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin C and Folacin, anemia and reduced oxygen carrying capacity manifests in two ways: Low red blood cell count Malformed red blood cells. How can one increase their oxygen carrying capacity? There is a distinct difference between unethical , harmfu l, EPO-blood doping methods and the safe nutrition that effectively increases individual oxygen-ca rrying capac ity. Once can improve their hea lth and oxygen carrying capac ity similar to EPO without compromising the athlete's health or integrity. EPO levels up to 48% safely improve performance in males, however beyond this level, the risk of compro mised health increases. Look to dietary suggestions below regarding vitamins, minera ls, proteins, and avoiding anemia to ensure oxygen carrying capacity. Can excess EPO can be lethal? Yes. The margin between effective and lethal quantities of EPO is very narrow. EPO use can be LETHAL. Many athletes seeking to derive its performance -enhancing effects have died from incorrectly-administered EPO. Inappropriate use of exogeno us EPO can cause elevated hematoc rit levels (i.e. thickened blood that is difficult to pump). Elevated EPO increases the risk of heart attack due to the increase in hematocrit. Choosing sustainable, healthy choices is preferred. Exogenous EPO is totally cleared from the urine with in 48 hours of its administration and is cleared from the blood within 72 hours of its administration but its physiologica l effects prevai l for severa l months).[3) A look at EPO's complex pathway further illustrates a complex physiologica l process below, see PATHWAYS[4]. Resea rch followed over 7,000 middle-aged men for more than 12 years, and discovered that the risk of diabetes increases proportionate to hematocrit increase.[19) [20). Men with hematocrits above 48 percent have a 400% increased risk of non-insul in-depe ndent-diabe tes mellitus. The upper recommended levels for a female is slightly lower at 45%. This nutritional intervent ion parallels exerc ise intensitys effect for increasing EPO. Nutritional and training interventions for reso lving low EPO levels during iron 

NIH-000502 supplementation (only prescribed by a physician who should monitored progress) shou ld not be permitted above a refere nce ra nge of 48% in males and 45% in fema les. Similar resea rch confirms this repo rt.[21] [22] [23] Does exercise intensity increase EPO? It's comp licated. Roberts & Smit h measured the effects of exerc ise-ind uced hypoxia on the physiological production of erythropoie tin. Twenty athletes exercised for 3 min at 106-112% maximal oxygen consumption. The fitness of these athletes prov ides a physiological env ironment for increasing EPO naturally from short 3- minute all-out intervals . Estimated oxyhemoglobin saturat ion was measured by reflective probe pulse oximetry (Nellcor N200) and was validated against arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation by CO-oximetry in eight athletes. Serum erythropoietin concentrat ions, as measured using the IN CST AR Epo-Trac radio immunoassay, increased significant ly by 19-37% at 24 hours post-exercise in 11 participants who also had an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation< or= 91 %. Decreased ferritin levels and increased reticulocyte coun ts were observed at 96 hours post-exercise. However , no significant changes in EPO levels were observed in nine non-desaturating athletes and eight non-exe rcise contro ls. Good agreement was shown between arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and percent estimated oxyhaemoglobin saturation (limits of agreement= -3.9 to 3.7. They concluded that a short 3 minutes supramax imal exerc ise pe riod cou ld induce both hypoxem ia and increased erythropo ietin levels in we ll-train ed indi viduals. The dec line of arteria l hypoxemia levels below 91 % during exercise appears to be necessary for the exercise -induced elevation of serum erythropoietin levels. Furthermore, reflective probe pulse oximetry was found to be a valid predic tor of percent arter ial oxyhemoglob in saturatio n during supramaxima l exercise when percent estimated oxyhemog lob in satura tion> or= 86%.[9] What naturally occur ing, nutritional building block s aid in EPO production? Protein adequacy is a factor in erythropoietin (EPO) production . Inadequate protein nutrition can reduce the EPO produced. The erythroid response to Erythropoietin (EPO) is highly dependent on dietary protein adeq uacy and qua lity . The mouse spleen is an erythropo ietic organ, whic h contains an EPO-responsive cell population that can be easily amplified by administration of the hormone. Researchers determined the effect of a protein-free diet offered freely to mice up to two days after injection of r-Hu EPO (l000mU /200 ul) on the response of the above popul ation. Sp lenic cell suspen sions from control and experimental mice were prepared in microwells containing 400 mU r-Hu EPO and appropriate medium. The response to EPO was evaluated in terms of 3H-thymidine uptake. The results obta ined indicate that acute ly induced protei n restriction suppressed the response of the EPO-responsive splenic cell population to EPO when it was imposed on mice immediately after hormone injection, and suggest the appearance of deficient rates of differentiation of erythropoietic units by protein restriction .[ 11] Adequate dietary protein intake is 1.4-1.7 grams/kilogram body weight per day for an endurance 

NIH-000503 athlete. What other nutritional elements and processes affect the natural product ion of EPO and the body's oxygen carrying capacity? Dietary Iron. To ensure oxygen carry ing capacity, one shou ld take the recommended dai ly va lue of iron. Food sources of iron are red meat, liver, and egg yolks. Most flour , bread, and cereals are iron-fortified. If the diet continues to be iron-deficient , only a physician should prescribe and supervise iron supplementation. Ca lories. Calor ies are needed for EPO production . Calorie sufficie ncy (in spite of exercise expense) is required for optimal EPO-r elease. If training is causing weight loss, then EPO loss may be occurring. In order to test the hypo thesis that the early cessat ion of erythropoietin (Ep) production during hypobaric hypoxia is induc ed by lowered food intake, researchers compa red the plasma Ep titer of rats after expos ure to continuous hypoxia ( 42.6 kPa = 7000 m altitud e) for 4 days in fed or fasted rats after exposure to discontinuous hypoxia. They found that plasma Ep was rather low afte r 4 days of cont inuous hypoxia . Their findings showed that fasting lowers the EPO-response to hypoxia in normal rats [12]. Hormone and Glucose. EPO production also has hormonal-dependant roots complex ly related to glucose metabolism, and calorie adequacy . The effect of Thyroid-T3 replacement and glucose supplemen tation on erythropo ietin production was investigated in fasted hypoxic rats. It was found that 48 hr of fasting significantly reduced the circulating levels of thyroid hormones and the prod uction of renal and extra renal erythropo ietin in response to hypoxia . These effects of fasting were comp lete ly abo lished when the an imals had free access to 25% glucose solution as drinking water , despite their Lack of protein intake. Replacement doses of T3 (0.5 micrograms / 100 gm per day) restored erythropoietin production in the fasted anima ls but a lso increased the response of the fed contro ls. To avoid the effec t of endoge nous T3, the experiments were repeated in thyroidectomized rats. EPO prod uction in athyroid rats was found to be markedly decreased , with values equivalent to those found in nonnal fasted animals, and were not affected by fasting or glucose supp lementa tion. Replaceme nt doses of T3 increased EPO product ion in all three gro ups, but the fasted anima ls needed five times as much T3 to obta in a response similar to that observed in the fed group. Glucose supplementation enhanced the effect ofT3 in the fasted animals but did not completely restore them. These results indicate that caloric deprivat ion is primarily respons ible for the decreased EPO production induced by fasting and that this effec t is proba bly mediated by both a decreased level of T3 and a decreased responsiveness to it.[13] A calorie deficit therefore requires 500% more Thyroid Hormone (T3) to maintain EPO leve ls. This is a good reason for monitoring calorie intake during high h·aining calori e expense. Iron abso rbtion. Dietary intervent ions sign ifican tly advance nonheme iron abso rptio n rate during EPO production. It is very important to include foods to 

NIH-000504 enhance nonheme iron absorption, especially when an exercise-induced iron loss is high or when no heme iron is consumed, such as in a vegetarian diet. Absorption of heme iron is very efficient; the presence of red meat increases absorption of non￾heme iron +400%. Only 1-7% of the nonheme iron in vegetable staples in rice, maize, black beans, soybeans, and wheat are absorbed consumed alone. Vitamin C improves the rate of absorption of nonheme iron from red meats. Diets that include a minimum of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily provide adequate vitamin C to boost nonheme iron absorption. Calcium , polyphenols , tannins from tea, and phytates (a component of plant foods), rice, and grains inhibit the absorption of nonheme iron. Some of the protein found in soybeans inhibits nonheme iron absorpt ion. Most hea lthy individuals maintain normal iron stores when the diet provides a wide variety of foods. However, if the diet contains large amounts of oxalates and phytates from dark green leafy vegeta bles and whole cerea l grains the absorption of iron decreases due to binding with iron in the gut. High absorption of heme iron is further advanced by foods containing vitamin C in an acid environment found of the stomach. The recommended for daily iron intake is between 10-18 milligrams for adult males and postmenopausal females. Most endurance athletes consume too much iron. Iron is added to breads, cereals, and most packaged foods. From a computer-generated dietary analysis on 16 endurance athletes and 9 non￾athletes, iron intake from their reported food intake was assessed. The results of this data is as follows: GROUP PERCENT DAILY IRON (RD I/RDA) MALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE 279% FEMALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE 193% MALE SEDENTARY 158% FEMALE SEDENTARY 115% What are some food combinations that incr ease the absortion of iron? 

NIH-000505 How foods are combined may affect iron absorption rate. Excess iron overdose is unhealthy and should be avoided. Common side effects of acute iron ove rload are gastro-intes tinal pain, constipation, nausea, and heartbwn. Excess iron levels may generate a continuous low-grade infection. Foods are the best source of iron. The best food source of iron is liver and red meats. These foods contain heme iron, which is better absorbed than non-heme iron. No n-heme iron can be found in dark green, leafy vegeta bles (spinach, chard and kale) and whole cereal gra ins (bran and whole wheat bread). Include dark green, leafy vegetables and who le cerea l grains in the daily diet. Oxalates and phytates found in dark green leafy vegetables and whole cereal gra ins decrease the absorption of iron because they bind with iron in the gash·ointestinal tract. Iron fo11ified cereals increase iron from the diet. Anemia may develop on a meat-free diet and/or if the iron store or intake is low. Red meat contains arachidonic acid, an EPO-p recu rsor nutrient, but it also conta ins high leve ls of saturated fats and cholesterol suggesting a little (now and then) is good but too much will harmfully compromise cardiovascular lipid levels. Adding iron to the diet in supplementa l form is not reconunended except under the supervision of a physician who is monitoring blood serum leve ls for a spec ific outcome. It has been shown that eating red meat 1-2 per week may contribute to providing substrates known to regenerate EPO as shown in anima l research . The ability of Arachidonic Acid (AA), the bisenoic pro staglandin precursor to stimulate erythropoi esis and Eiythropoietin (EP) Production in exhypox ic polycythemic mice and the programmed isola ted perfused canine kidney was found to stimul ate erythropoi esis when administered to exhypoxic polycythernic mice in the lowest dose tested (50 microgram/kg i.p.). Endogenous ly synthesized prostaglandins, their intermediates and/or other products of AA metabolism, such as prostacyclin and prostaglandins play an importan t role in the control EPO production.[14] Hematocrit levels are restored through the supplying dietary or supplementa l specific substrates to support the body's natural EPO-produ cing mechanisms during endurance exercise stress.

NIH-000506 Copper- 2 mg Zinc 40 mg daily ---->(Do not take zinc in amounts over 40 mg daily as it may interfere with metabolism of iron and copper) More Dietary Recommendations There is a method to improv e iron uptake in the absence of oxalate or phytate rich foods previously men tioned above. If hematocrit, hemog lobin, or fe1ritin blood lab measures are low, the athlete may add 1-gram of vitamin C to a 3-4 ounce lean cut of red meat cooked in an iron skillet one to two times each week. A complete dietary protoco l for cance r patients going through chemotherapy and radiation was published and is applicable to over-trained endurance athletes who present low hematocrit levels. [ 16] Conclusion In normal adults, the kidneys produce EPO, which initiates approximately 90% of natural erythropoietin production. Tissue oxygenation exposure regulates the production of erythropoietin . Less oxygen saturat ion in the air we inhale (eithe r by altitude or hypoxic interval training) stimulates the kidneys to activate the chemica l messengers to instruct the bone marrow to increase the production of EPO to resolve the lack of oxygen exposure. Hypoxia or Anemi a stimulates the kidney production of erythropoietin to increase production red blood cells. EPO released from the kidneys increases the rate of red blood cell division and differentiation of specific cells in the bone marrow. Dietary deficiency of spec ific foods and micronutrients, hormone imbalance, and lack of specific hypoxic training stress inhibit the endogenous (natural) production of EPO. Additionally, nutritional imbalance from caloric restriction (or exercise related expense), dehydrat ion, fluid intoxication, excess calcium, excess inositol, excess oxalates foods, excess phytic acid from cereal gra ins, or a lack of hypoxic interval trainin g all inhibit the natural production of EPO also. [17] [18], Manipulating diet for protein and total calorie adequacy, monitoring hydration, using supplements, timing food combinations, adding weekly hypoxic exercise followed by easy or rest days all increases the release of natural EPO for healthy maximal oxygen carrying capacity. Plus, there are many ways to use diet and wellness to ensure that the body's production of red blood cells is sound and that their oxygen carrying capacity is functioning.

One of the statements attributed to you puzzled me. Th e articl e Dr. Anthony Fauci Says He Would Like a 'Dramatic' Reduction of Personal Interactions at Social Gatherings to Fight Coronavirus, by Donica Phifer, newsweek.com March 15, 2020 02:20 PM https ://www .newswee k.com/dr-anthony-fauci-savs-he-would-like-dramatic￾reduction-personal-interactions-social-14924 1 O" quotes you as saying, "I've said many times if you just leave it alone and left the virus to its own devices then it'll go way up and it'll come down naturally over a period of several weeks ," Fauci said. "Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy, in France, and certainly in China, that's what happened ." NIH-000509 

NIH-000510 Question: Is the implication that the virus would have stopped spreading rapidly in China even if their government had not instituted drastic measures to curtail the epidemic? Put another way: Is it not correct that the drastic measures implemented by the Chinese government were very helpful in halting the spread of the virus in China? From yet another angle: Is it correct that the public health measures adopted in South Korea and Taiwan have proved very effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic? Thank you very much again for your hard work, Martin

We, the dental community , already high risk personnel , are at an even higher risk at this point and time. Many of those who do not work in the dental community are not aware of how high risk our cun-ent situation is. For 8-12 hours a day we are creating aerosols while sitting 8-12 inches from a persons open mouth. These aerosols contain saliva and blood drop lets, along with billions of other bacteria and materials . In dentistry , saliva is considered a blood borne pathogen. Although OSHA requires Level 3 masks for all aerosol producing procedmes, not all offices are complying. This DOES NOT matter anyway as we know SURGICAL MASKS DO NOT FILTER OUT THE COVID-19 virus. I ask that you suspend non essential dental pro cedures such as dental clean ings and other procedures that are non-emergent. That we triage patients and accept EMERGENCIES ONLY. We are at such a HIGH risk , not only to ourselves and our families, but a HIGH RISK to spreading this virus COMMUNITY wide . Many ofus are taking extra precaut ions but screeni ng patients, but with a up-to-14 day incubation period, that obvious ly does not matter. Plea se hear our plea to addJes s our concerns.

I represent TytoCare, a company that built the industry's first and only all￾in-one medical device that pairs with a virtual exam, going beyond the means of audio and visual. Tyto Home, an OTC and FDA approved/c leared device is meant to either synchronously or asynchronously examine a patient with capabilit ies to capture heart/lung/gastrointestinal sounds, ear/throat/skin exams, and temperature . Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, Tyto has experienced an influx of orders worldwide to support those that need to be monitored when quarantined. I would like to offer Tyto's assistance here in the U.S. and think through ways and oppo rtunities that the product can make a difference. Please see a few a couple of examples on how Tyto is making a difference below : • Patient Quarantine/Discharge at Home o Design: patients receive TytoHome or have it delivered for remote evaluation by infectious disease specialists • Example: Home Admission Service with TytoCare • Create & manage quarantine locations, onsite or offsite o Setup: Patients do a self-exam with TytoClinic while a prov ider evaluates them from a distance • Patient is remotely guided to fully disinfect the device and station before it's returned to staff for a second round disinfection • Example: Nursing Home Triage Thank you for all that you do during this difficult time .

You have already helpe d so many through the current pandemic . I know you will understand my concern. But, please help me spread this message as we ll. In light of public school closures ... these include chil dren and young people from kindergarten through high school. These closures also include preschool programs (Volunta ry Pre-Kin Florida) for 4-year-olds that are part of a public elementary school. These school closures do not apply to children whose ages range from infants through preschoo l (including VPK) receiving care and education in private, corporate , or faith -based centers . My center is one of these , and we are not closing. This is a business decision. No kids = No money . At what price ? We have more than 90 infants, todd lers and young children enro lled at ou r center, with 20-plus employees on premises thro ughout the day between the hours of 6:30 am and 6:00 pm . Ours is a 5-Star rated, NAEYC accredited preschool program . I have 17 t hree-year-old preschool childre n in my classroom on any given day, with 3 t eachers assigned to this room. This is a high quality program . Please explain how I am supposed to take recomme nded precautions against COVID-19? Does social distance apply only to adults? If not, please help me know how to maintain social distance of 3 feet between child ren and adults at arrival or departure times when I am helping a child with separation from their prima ry care giver o r saying goodbye at the end of t he day? How do I maintain social distance between children during center time in the block area , in the NIH-000538 

dramatic play area, in the classroom library or computer center, during story time or music circle? Our 3 table surfaces are used for multiple activities through the day including meals￾and they seat six children at each table. Friday afternoon, I had 9 children sharing space and materials engaged in cooperative play for an extended period outside in a sandbox that measures S'xl0' ... you do the math. Our spacing for cots at nap time is considerably less than 3 feet. We have no hot water in our classroom for hand washing for children or staff which is considered a safety measure. We are relentless in our efforts to teach hygiene to 3-year-old children who cough, sneeze, vomit upon (and occasionally may spit, bite or lick) each other or a staff member. we work to teach them to use a tissue instead of their hand/arm/shirt to wipe a runny nose ... then throw it in the trash and wash their hands again. Believe me when I say a determined child can sing "Happy Birthday" twice in an amazingly short time--definitely less tha n 20 seconds--all the while whipping through instructions to wash the tops, bottoms and fingers of their hands while they sing. Hand washing is monitored by 3 adults through the day to ensure it happens after each cough, sneeze, nose wipe and use of the bathroom. Hands are washed after sensory play indoors or out, before am snack, lunch, and pm snacks (and sometimes during), and when we transit ion from outside play. At a minimum, these 17 children are taking turns washing hands (at our single sink) six times during a full day at preschool￾before we add in those runny noses, coughs or sneezes. Avoid touching shared objects ... seriously? We work daily to teach these 3-year-olds to share materials and space. Yes, we disinfect our toys regularly and our room daily--but that stuffed animal may move from dramatic play to the reading nook and to a nap cot all in one day and may be held by a different child with each move. our families send a blanket from home for their child to use through the week at nap time-along with a soft "sleep toy" if this is needed, to sooth their child to sleep. These items are stored in the child's open "cubby box" in the classroom through the week . Do we know how log COVID-19 "l ives" on soft surfaces? I am convinced school closures are necessary at this time to stem community spread of COVID￾19. I understand the strain on multiple levels this will inevitably put on families to provide care for and education of their own children for this period. But-young children can contract this virus and can spread it even though they may not demonstrate symptoms themselves. Or, what may be dismissed as allergies or "just a cold" may not be. Young children can carry this virus home to their fam ily and neighborhoods just as easily as a school age child; and, they can certainly bring it into our center from their home. How many of our children in preschool depend upon elderly family members for their care? We have infants as young as 6 weeks old and children through 5 years old at our center . How many young children in care are we willing to expose? How many and which grandparents are we going to risk?

Sofar, we've been acting in a reactive instead of proactive fashion. Not anymore. People need to realize that we are entering war time. We need to act fast, in light speed to beat the virus. 4. Healthcare workers need to most strongly protected - treat it as airborne if needed at the hospitals and pharmacies. Supplies of essential protective medical supplies for healthcare workers are equally important as supplies needed for the patients. Make sure supply chain from China is uninterrupted; and have American companies to start making masks, ventilators etc. Plan ahead. NIH-000545

Instruct patient to self-treat or be treated by family at home. If we ever come to it, recruit and train volunteers ( how and whom?) to help taking care of patients. Dr. Fauci. Clock is ticking.

However, my husband, William Ha ll, who is a Certified Gen eral Rea l Estate Appraise r, is out in the field all day perform ing interior appra isals. I have reac hed out to all our appraisal management compa nies with this question to ask their lenders. Considering the abundance of caution everyone is taking and the refinance industry seeing unprecedented volume, is there any talk about lenders moving to exterior only appra isals (and possibly following up after with an interior)? We heard from ServiceLink, a Fidelity company, and they have not heard any word from their national banks/lenders changing to exterior only appraisals at this time . Thank you very much!

A.S. Fauc i. Sent from my iPhone On Mar 15, 2020 , at 4:15 PM, ABCDE FGHIJK (b)( >wrote : ---------- Dear Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, It's critical to disinfect droplets, aerosols and surfaces continuous ly to prevent or reduce or slow down the spread of COVID-19. The best way is using UVC ultraviolet light. UVC's wavelength is germicidal and it is capable to inactivate coronavirus by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting its DNA because Waveleng ths between about 200nm and 300nm are strongly absorbed by nucleic acids . The absorbed energy can result in defects including pyrimidine dimers. These dimers can prevent replication or can prevent the express ion of necessary proteins.resulting in the death or inactivation of the coronavirus. Fluorescent light lamps emit ultraviolet (UV) light , including UVC ultraviolet light. I think it's necessary to use fluorescent tube light lamps and CFL (Compact fluorescent lamps) lamps in hospitals, Health centers, stores , supermarkets, elevators, public lavatory , toilets, restrooms and other public places and should always be on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to be effective. Research has shown that Fluorescent light lamps must be installed without any glass shade or decorative shade and should be at least 40 watts . I hope you find the UVC-based continuous disinfection solution helpful. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, P.Salimi NIH-000551

I have some thoughts on the current COVID -19 spread and in general about other virus with unknown cure or immunity vaccine. In research, we have adhered to a scientific method necessary for the protection of the public in the development of new technology and treatment. There are times howeve r whe n that Boyle method and ph ilosophy should give way to Desca ,tes approac h. The current infection has thus far shown a predilection for causing severe illness in men more than women and in adults over 30 sparing children from mortality. I believe there is a reason for this and it's not because of past exposure to other coronovirus strains. I believe it is because of children being in the middle of or having recently completed their immunization schedule for school. These immuni zations are abso lutely not prov iding an immuni ty to COVID-19, BUT, they are causing an increase in the numb ers of gamma delta t cells and NK cells. The children are responding better to a virus with an 5 .1 day median incuba tion period because of the higher values of gd and nk cells. Women hav e a better gd and nk: cell response to the flu and other viral infections which could explain why there is a gender difference in mortality. I would suggest that adults update their vaccines and especially the hep b. Interestingly, the hep viruses illicit a better gd and nk cell response and although most Wes tern countries require hep b for health care workers, the immunization rate in China is only 60% which may explain the high mortality among health care prov iders.

We're writing to ask you to consider spearheading an additional initiative in this effort. As you know, one of our greatest immediate needs is an adequate supply of ventilators for use in hospitals . We will face a severe shortage of this crucial equipment during a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. This will creat e a bottleneck in our ability to de liver care , a situation where we have to triage who should live and who should die . Tragically, we see this happening already in Italy. This is a situation we must avoid. So we propose to immediately help existing factories to increase production , to convert other existing factorie s for the production of ventilators and to build new factories to do so. Some of this will take a long time to accomplish but this pandemic is also predicted to be w ith us for a long time. We must stay ahead. We should make an all-out effort to supply our hospitals properly and quickly. We are in a time of war and we must make the commensurate effort now. We believe we have the knowledge and the resources to do such a thing. We just need the will, and the leadership. We're writing to urge you to use your position of leadership to make this happen.

NIH-000574 I would like to post this widely today , but want your input first. Can you please make suggestions/add itions/corrections? Thanks so much! Jon The World Health Organization has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic -- official recognition that the virus respects no borders and now affects masses of people in countries all over the world. And there is no denying the world is changing, in painful ways . We see it in financial markets, where prices are plunging -- and in supermarkets, where customers are stripping shelves bare. All driven by fear, as the number of virus cases grows with each passing day. While we may feel powerless over this threat, we are not. There are important things we can and must do -- and right now. To borrow a phrase from the war on terror, the coronavirus only has to be right once to infect us. We have to be right every time to prevent it. So, every time you cough or sneeze , use a tissue or the crook of your arm. Every time you think of it, wash your hands -- as frequently as you can. Every time you can, practice "social distancing" -- stay away from others during this outbreak. Social distancing is now being enforced throughout our society. Schools are closing, sporting events of every kind are being canceled. The curtain has even come down on Broadway shows as the Great White Way goes dark. Despite our best efforts , it's likely many of us will eventually get infected by the virus , since we have no immunity to it. If that's the case, you may ask, does it really matter when we get infected? The answer is a resounding yes! And here's why: slowing the spread of coronavirus -- and consequently delaying infections -- can make an enormous difference in our ability to handle the pandemic . Take a look at this illustration. It appeared in the Economist and is based on a CDC report . The blue curve shows what happens when you do nothing . The number of infections peaks relatively quickly. This can overwhelm a healthcare system that is not prepared to handle such a huge number of patients. Emergency rooms and hospitals can become overloaded. We may see shortages of medical supplies -- including protective gear and breathing machines -- and shortages of healthcare workers, especially if many of them become infected. But look at the yellow curve. It shows what can happen when you slow the epidemic. The outbreak is stretched out. And while it may last longer, the peak number of infections is much lower, putting less stress on the healthcare system and allowing better care for each patient. It also gives scientists more time to develop new treatments and vaccines . 

NIH-000575 Is there any evidence this works? Absolutely, especially when coupled with the time-proven technique of aggressive testing to find and isolate infected people as early as possible. In China , where there has been strict quarantine and social distancing in the epicenter of the outbreak, new infections have dramatically slowed. In South Korea, where health officials cleverly used drive-through testing, we're also seeing the number of new cases slow down. And there 's a history lesson from the 1918 flu pandemic . Back then , Philadelphia held a parade attended by several hundred thousand people. Soon, every hospital bed in the city reportedly was filled with sick patients . Saint Louis, on the other hand, practiced social isolation and saw fewer cases. So we have work to do, and it won't be easy, because it means changing the way we live our daily lives and how we interact with our neighbors . And we have to start now -- when we can make the most difference . And here's something we need to keep in mind. We are all in this together. So even as we keep a distance from each other physically , we need to stay close emotionally. Social isolation is bad for your health! If ever there was a time to call or video chat with friends and loved ones. And don't forget to reach out to the elderly --who may be alone and afraid. Demonstrating grace under pressure is easier said than done. But that is this doctor's prescription for getting through this . And , if we treat each other with kindness and empathy, we will.

I didn't know if your old email still worked, so I'm using the directory listing by NIH in addition. I have some ideas to share with you about the use of tools in the current war on covid-19. Your 'close the bars' statement is right on target with what I was writing when I heard you say it . It was a great illustration counterintuit ive to what will work . You could have more correctly said keep the bars open only to those in their twenties and thirties. Five minutes later Mayor DeBlasio said everything is on the table including closing bars and restaurants! Below you will see me argue why there are better approaches and this total closure approach is the wrong move. Selective participation will work in our favor to blunt the curve! Total closure will not work and can work against us! In a period of two weeks demand for medical treatment can go from 50% of hospital capacity to 200% due to disease progression and binomial expansion. You know the math and ideas, so there's no need to go into them. There is a need to closely consider how available tools are being used to mitigate an overwhelm ing of the health care system. I can tell you now that what needs to be done isn't being done and that the road we are on now will at most postpone crossing the threshold of 100% capacity. It will not achieve the desired result of distributing cases over a greater time period so that being overwhelmed is avoided . Consider the curves: The 'without protective measures' curve is the normal distr ibution as modeled by the binomial distribut ion. The 'w ith protect ive measures' distribution is what we want to achieve, although that would be fore ign to an experimenta list. We don't want the number of cases to exceed capacity as indicated by the horizontal dotted line. If the 'protective measures' are social distancing, school closings, entertainment/sporting cancelations, restaurant closings, and hygiene and similar uniformly applied measures, the 'with' curve should have a shape similar to the 'without' curve, just shifted to the right, unless there is some unpartitioned factor interaction. The flattened curve WILL NOT RESULT because errors should be random and SAMENESS OF TREATMENT PRODUCES SAMENESS OF EFFECT. With UNIFORM application of measures the curve afte r application will still exceed a height showing the system capacity has been exceeded. NIH-000579 

NIH-000580 We could expect to flatten the mesokurtic 'without' curve into the platykurtic 'with' curve by systematic time staggering in the use of the protective measures and selectively apply ing the measures to drive toward herd immunity. As immunity builds toward HIT (Herd Immunity Threshold), there will be greater and greater slowing of infections as the linkages for transmission decrease. There are two points to consider here. The first point is whether measures should be applied in a uniform and blanket manner. The answer is typically no when the effect is on an existing population because the curve won't flatten. There are two aspects of the application of measures to consider. Is the effect of the application defining the population or is it an effect within a defined population. In the instance of halting all air traffic to the US from China, the population is being defined and altered if influx is allowed and that would both increase the infections and population turbulence. There would be movement away from HIT. Any measure such as people influx, which moves the US away from HIT, is to be avoided. School, restaurant, and sporting event closings need to be examined in relationship to their impact on an existing, not an increasing population . The actions have many criteria to influence them, but from the viewpoint of keeping the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed closings that are staggered, variable, and alternating will work to increase movement toward HIT and promote flattening of the 'with' curve. The second point to consider is whether we can move the US toward HIT by age selective application of available measures. The answer is yes and this could provide the best tool. Susceptibility and strengths of covid-19 infections covary with age. People less than 30 rarely have severe infections and the younger ones may not become infected. People under 40 show a low frequency of severe infection. It will be important to know if there is a large age cohort exempt from infection because that would undermine part of the result from selective application of measures or limit the sampling age because these people wouldn't develop immunity , but might contribute to delaying herd effects. If they develop immunity their contribution can be substantial and they can be kept separated from more vulnerable people until and unless it is established that there isn't a need. Opening night clubs, sporting events, restaurants, and other places to people in their twenties and th irties will build immunities, break infection transmission links, and move toward HIT with little or no risk to the people or the rest of the herd. Have admission to the venues by existing ID, like a driver's license with age, and have agreement that they do not mingle with vulnerable older people. Leaving the bars open to people in their 20's and 30's will flatten the curve!

Your wise guidance regarding a temporary national lockdown may greatly help in reducing the spread of COVID-19. If this action were to occur it should be in phases: Phase 1: Federal Quarantine. Effective Immediately until 4 MAY 2020 ( or further notice) - ONLY Key and Essential federal employees of all agencies (IC included) should repo1t to work. Eve1yone else is on administrative leave. While buildings are empty, staff remaining should conduct deep cleaning (air systems, etc.) to ensure a healthy environment when employees come back to work. Phase 2: Federal recall: Beginning 4 MAY 2020, federal employees are called back to work on an as-needed basis (indefinitely) depending on how the virus trends. Excluding postal workers, that accounts for nearly 2 million full-time employees. There should be a mandatory home-quarantine so people are not out spreading the disease. Phase 3: Mitigation and recovery. Federal agenc ies need to produce mitigation measures ( crisis action plans) should something of this nature occur in the future. Federal agencies must be ready to respond in an organized manner when a cns1s occurs. Throughout this COVID-19 event, military and law enforcement must have an increased presence to prevent mass hysteria and mob mentality. Increased military and law enforcement presence may help enforce the home quarantine measures and prevent looting and other crimes that tend to occur during crisis events. NIH-000589

Now that stores are reduc ing hours to clean and restock the stores overnight, the best hours might be first thing in the morning . For example for Walmart , the hours designated for those 60 and over could be 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. This could reduce their exposure to younger people who might have the virus but who are asymptomatic (or relatively so).

First, we have developed a gene expression system, our C 1 cell line which is significantly more efficient than traditional cell lines being used by Big Pharma to manufacture recombinant vaccines and drugs . The hyper produc tive Cl cells can be grown at flexible commercial scales and are proving to be the most efficient, cost effective way to produce the tens of millions of preventative vaccine s and/ or antibody treatments the world so desperately needs. In a collaborat ion with Sanofi, C 1 cells were developed to produce recombinant proteins for use in manufacturing a lower cost better performing influenza vaccine. After conducting a NIH-000607 

mice trial Sanofi concluded that the use of our Cl platform resulted in equal or better influenza protection, using a lower amount of vaccine that could be produced at 10-30 times higher productivity levels. The Original Sanofi Presentation can be found at the following link: https://www.dyadic.com/wp -content/up loads/2018/01/Sanofi - Pasteur -C 1-Presentation.pdf (b) (4) Working togethe r we can "Keep America Safe" by helping to addre ss the immediate coronavirus outbreak , be better prepared for future infectious diseases, pandemic, and epidemic outbreaks, and leveraging this unfortunate situation to advance biopharmaceutical manufacturing to help speed development, lower the cost and improve the performance of NIH-000608 

biologic vaccines and drugs such as insulin, seasona l flu and other vaccines and antibod ies to make healthcare more accessible and affordable to patients. I am confident that a meeting with you can be very productive in further stimulat ing big pharma and other research institutions to speed effective, low cost vaccines and antibodies to market.

PLEASE CONSIDER THIS CORRECTED VERSION INST ED. Dear Dr. Fauci, You may not remember but we have met years back when I was at Stanford University and Training with the late Donald E Thomas to consider cell therapy of HIV based on the use of reduced intensity , non-myeloablative conditioning in preparatio n for stem cell transp lantation to induce tolerance and then apply cell therapy with donor lymphocytes which I have proposed for consideration of treatment of patients with HIV with secondary malignancy. The purpose of this email is to try and capture your attention in order to consider a new treatm ent option for COVID-19 that can be applied for patients in need with evidence of disease with no delay. Whereas many companies focus on development of anti-corona vaccine, I believe the more rational approach should be to develop treatment for COVID-19 and then, if the virus will be deleted and/or the disease controlled or modified, vaccination will result without the need for specific corona-specific vaccination which is not yet available and by the time it may be available it may no longer be relevant. I am serving as the Medical Director of a company in Hungary and we believe that one simple and safe experimental treatment of patients with existing viral disease may already be at hand, (bH 4J NIH-000617 

I will greatly appreciate if you could give me a call or have one of your colleagues contact me and then I will be able to discuss the concept in greater details , after I will provide supportive scientific and clinical literature.

Fauci Sent from my iPhone On Mar 14, 2020 , at 12: 19 PM, Mike Bett s (b)(6)>w rote: ------- I wanted to convey an idea I had with regard to the coronavirus. It seems to me that trying to contain the virus as we are doing at present will be futile. Since the virus can be present for many days without a person having any symptoms, you would literally need to test everyone at the same time to determine who has it--an impossible task . I have a different thought. We know that the virus is especially dangerous for the old and/or immunosuppressed. IMO we should be focusing all of our efforts on keeping that group from becoming infected. To do so that group should be encouraged to self-isolate, to limit their social interactions and other groups should be instructed to avoid them. Sort of a reverse-quarantine idea. All testing would be done within those groups and all groups would also be encouraged to continue with the hygienic suggestions they've already received . The problem right now is that the media has created a panic. Last night my wife and I went to the local Whole Foods and many of the shelves were empty and healthy younger people were wearing masks . The message is not getting out that the virus is almost solely dangerous to the elderly and immunosuppressed. [Why aren't the demograph ics being released? That in itself could calm many people.] With my suggestion, exposures to them would be diminished, significantly reducing the number of deaths, as well as NIH-000624 

the potential impact on hospitals. Any person outside of that group that was severely affected could be identified and treated. Quarantining otherwise healthy people outside of those groups who finally demonstrate symptoms--like the NBA players--is ridiculous. They are likely to get the sniffles and have also already spread the virus. As long as they're not spreading it to the endangered group we should not worry about it. In sum, we need to isolate the vulnerable and realize that the mortality rate for people outside of that group is likely lower than the flu. Of course, while this occurs we are working on finding treatments and vaccines. But sending home workers who have next to no likelihood of being significantly impacted by this virus is ridiculous. The virus hits hardest the old and infirm, two groups that are most likely NOT to even be in the workforce! To me, this solution is a lot simpler than what is being tried right now and is much more likely of success. To everyone besides the endangered group this virus is literally less dangerous than the flu. There is no reason that anyone outside of the endangered group should have any concern at all and we need to make that clear. Please let me know what you think. Sincerely , Michael Betts (b)( NIH-000625

NIH-000648 Miller 1 1University of Minnesota, Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN, United States, 2 Gamida Cell, Jerusalem, Israel Background: NK cells have the capacity to kill tumor targets and potential in cancer therapy. Limitations include specificity, persistence after infusion and how to maxim ize NK cell activity in vivo. We report results of a Phase 1 clinical trial of GDA-201, a cellular product composed of Natural killer (NK) cells from healthy donors expanded ex-vivo with nicotinamide (NAM) and IL-15, a unique ex vivo activation strategy to induce persistence. Prior in vitro studies and pre-clinical models demonstrated that NAM-exposed NK cells exhibit augmented resistance against exhaustion and improved killing function, proliferation, and organ trafficking. We report safety and preliminary efficacy from a phase I trial of GDA-201 in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL or MM. Methods: Following donor apheresis, CD3-depleted mononuclear cells were cultured for 14-16 days with NAM (5mM) and IL-15 (20ng/m l), resulting in a 40-fold increase in NK cells and increased expression of CD62L from 2.9% to 21%. GDA-201 contained ~98% NK cells, and CD3 content was maintained at <0.5% (<5x10s/kg/dose). Pts with R/R B-cell NHL or MM received cyclophosphamide (400mg/m 2 IV x 3d) and fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /d IV x 3d), followed by two doses of GDA-201 (Days 0 and 2) and low-dose IL-2 (6 million units sc). Pts with NHL or MM received rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ) or elotuzumab (10 mg/kg), respectively, x 3 weekly infusions to enhance NK cell targeting through antibody￾dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Results: 25 pts were enrolled:11 with NHL (5 follicular, 5 diffuse large cell lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymp homa) and 14 with MM, in 3 cohorts of escalating GDA-201 dose; 14 pts received the maximum target dose (median 1.7 x 1Qscells/ kg, range 1.6-2.0 x 1 Os cells/kg). There were no dose lim iting toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia (n=2), increased creatinine, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema; all events were transient. There were no neurotoxic events, confirmed CRS, GVHD or marrow aplasia. One patient died of E-coli sepsis. r4mong 11 NHL pts, there were 7 CR and 1 PR with an overall response rate of 72%. Median duration of response is 11 months (CR patients) and 3 months (PR patients). In MM patients, 1 patient with extramedullary disease had CR and 4 had SD with median duration 2.5 months. In our previous study using overnight activated NK cells, persistence 7 days after adoptive transfer was limited. Using GDA-201, flow cytometry confirmed 

the persistence of donor NAM-NK in peripheral blood up to day 7-10 (day 7 range 2-55% donor NK cells; Figure 1), as well as enhanced in vivo proliferation (median Ki67 99%). In addition, the enhanced expression of the homing receptor CD62L correlated with trafficking to bone marrow and lymp h nodes in vivo as confirmed by flow cytometry of biopsied tissues at day 4. Conclusions: Cellular therapy using GDA-201 with mono clona l antibodies was safe, and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily pre-treated pts with advanced NHL and MM. Laboratory studies show that the GDA-201 product shows better persistence. Larger phase II studies are warranted.

I rea lize most of the needs rarely occur and when they do, there are extraordinary spikes in demand for certain products and expertise but one would think the re are ways to address this far bett er than we have. 3. Is there anything people should know that is not being emphasized? Thanks for any resp onse you can send, even if it's a few words. And keep up the good work . You are greatly appreciate d .

We have already tried the usual channels to contact the White House and the emergency authorization use division at the FDA but also wanted to bring this to your attention also. Medixair™ , an ultraviolet (UVc) air sterilizer with proven , well established unique patented germicidal technology to effectively and safely eradicate viruses and bacteria up to 99.9%. It is capable of delivering a log6 reduction in microbial concentration , by penetrating the nucleus of microorganisms, disrupting their DNA thus destroying the ability of the organism to reproduce ; effectively rendering it harmless . Medixair™ is a portable unit and can easily be installed in a variety of settings including hospitals , emergency rooms , waiting rooms , dentist offices , cruise ships and airport lounges. In both clinical trials and under in￾vitro testing conditions (see attached white paper), Medixair™ has been demonstra ted to be highly effective in protecting patients and health care workers from pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Clostrid ium Difficile) and also by preventing cross infection . Specifically , Medixair™ was tested and found effective for a strain of Coronavirus known as FCoV and thus COVID-19 would have the same susceptibility to eradication with UVc within a relatively short period of time (attached). NIH-000656 

NIH-000657 Medixair™ has been on the market since 2005 and is fully CE marked to EN standards. Currently it has been safely and effectively used in acute hospitals , dental surgeries , in UK, Malaysia, India, Israel, and Southern Africa . Please let us know how we can help make these units available for use in the US during this critical period of time.

Dr. Fauci, we will be setting up COVID-19 testing facilities and I wanted to ask your opinion regarding the following: Is it ok to expand our testing beyond the current strict testing criteria to includ e those with lesser symptoms or potential exposure whom we want to rule out Covid-19? We are concerned that while we isolate those with more severe symptoms who currently qualify for testing, the majority with lesser symptoms would be ambulatory and potentially spreading the illness to others. Plus, it is hard to get someone to isolate for 14 days without prov iding a diagnosis. Just as we can test those we suspect fo r Inf luenza A, Influenza Band RSV, it would be helpful to be able to test those we suspect with Covid-19, including healthcare workers with no symptoms but with possible exposure. Thank you for your time and your leadership for our nation's healthcare. Be well.

So good to see you now on TV in full charge. Your entire expression has changed almost like when I bumped into you in the Washington Metro after you had gotten off the plane with President Bush. I have an interesting question regarding pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization. One of our staff members phoned. Her father is a physician in France and has many physician acquaintances. She was told that the doctors believe that the older patients who received pneumococcal vaccine have less of a mortality than those who did not get the vaccine. When we did the studies and got the pneumococcal vaccine approved for the elderly in 1976 there was a battle about who should get it and whether was cost-effective. Since then, other studies have documented the benefit, especially in older people and you probably have received it. It is now routine but I know many elderly individuals have not gotten immunized. Historically, many, if not the majority of deaths from influenza in some of the past epidemics was a result of secondary infection with pneumococcus. I'm not hearing anything about urging people to get immunized with pneumococcal vaccine. The message would need to be clear so they don't confuse pneumococcal secondary infection with primary coronavirus infection. It would be a good idea for people to be urged to get the pneumococcal vaccine. If they had not received it. I'm not seeing any recommendations from the CDC or elsewhere regarding this.

I was hoping you would be willing to speak with me about our technology? Testing for the positive patients and finding a vaccine are essential, but containment is paramount. We have the only GERM CONTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY of it's kind. The ongoing Coronavirus and FLU viruses pose a significant threat to public health globally and here in the US. We have the most powerful solution to minimize infection and maximize protection against SARS, EBOLA, FLU, and all types of germs and viruses. With local 3rd party tested efficacy of 100%, no other technology anywhere can yield this result or sustainable 24/7/365 protection . XTI02 is a world exclusive containmen t technology with self-cleaning functions that can help minimize the risk of cross-contamination in hospitals, planes, public transportation, elevators, and public places. XTI02 technology works by forming an invisible protective layer on mostly ALL material surfaces (plastic, steel, glass , fabric, paper, walls, etc ... ). It is green, sustainable, and has yielded up to 100% efficacy proven by SGS LABS (US). NIH-000675

China had likely had the outbreak begin much ear lier but never acknowledged it; peop le traveling to China from the US could have returned and brough t the virus with them at a much earlier date . When thinkin g about the numb er of people my daughte r and I have known that bad a bout of respiratory illnes s with a cough that cont inued much longer than the t)'p ical cold, we are propos ing a theory that possibly Coron a made its entry here much earlier .... and this new expected outbreak may well be more of a contin uation and less threatening than possibly theo rized at this time. It is ju st a thought but I thought it was worth sharing. If true, we have already met the disease and the deaths attributed to "nom1al" flus and respiratory causes in the elderly and prev iously .impaired, may have been caused by Coronavirus.

This is clearly in addition to that due to the prevalence of elderly and immunocompromised patients; but smoking status overall may be a more significan t risk factor for clinically significant disease. In listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk factor for disease. I would suspect that smoking is at least one reason that such a high mortality has recently been seen in Italy, and China, and I expect that mortality rates, as well as rates of clinically significant cases, will also be increased in other populations with increased prevalences of smokers, and strongly associated with the prevalence of smoking in the given population. Of course, the reporting of severe disease will be modulated by the effective ness of the given population in containing the virus) as well as the effective reporting of clinical disease within the community, whether severe or not. ln listen ing to the news media, smok ing has not been addressed as a significant risk factor for disease. I think that it should be addressed. One wonde rs if it could be a modifiable risk factor, at least in certain patients (such as those who have not smoked for very long). NIH-000698 

NIH-000699 One also wonders whether this could be another good prognostic factor for limited reported/ clinically significant cases (and thus limited perceived spread) in the United States, obviously in addition to our early, effective containment measures.

I again showed them the CDC website hospital protocol Covid-19 recommendations but same response. And even was yelled at by the hospit al nursing superv isor for ask ing about it. I feel this is not safe at all for other patients , visitors and staff if the air is being recirculated not vented outside or through a hepa filter before recirc ulating back NIH-000700 

through the hospital. I don't know what to do. Please help. The hospital main phone number is Cb) (6) the Chief of the hospital is Cb) (6) I know you're extremely busy now but any help or guidance is appreciated .. even if it's just to confirm that any confirmed or suspected Covid -19 patient needs to be in a negative pressure room .

I attach a paper now in the MedRxiv that briefly describes the test. It has been used already in Wuhan and because of its simplicity, speed and visual output we think it would be very useful for use here in the US. We have just met with several people at Mass General Hospital and wil l be working with them for local validation here in MA.

External Email. Use caution when clicking links or opening file attachments. Nick, Following up on our conversation this weekend, I am including some information below about our Remote Patient Monitoring platform which we are making available for free to health agencies and organizations partic ipating in the response to COVID-19 in the United States. Remote Patient Mo nitoring with FollowApp is a HIPAA-Compliant system that helps health officia ls to diagnose, contain and treat this highly transmiss ible vira l threat by enabling the effective screening of large numbers of potentia l patients and to triage/prioritize targeted clinical interventions including the use of test kits. FollowApp's monitoring dashboard and patient mob ile applications (iOS and Android) can be used to deliver two of the keys to an effective response plan: 1) encourage "self-qua rantin ing'' (a fundamenta l epidemiologic tenet) and 2) off-load exploding cl inical volume threatening hospital Emergency Departments . Healthcare systems are thus able to maintain important contact with these populations and recommend targeted escalation of care when needed, while decreasing exposure to both clinicians and other patients. The public perception of the lethality of this globa l pandemic is fueling panic wh ich, in and of itself, is creating its own logistic issues that are already beginning to overwhelm hospita l Emergency Departments. The dilemma for health care systems, then, becomes a question of identifying subpopulations at increased risk wh ile at the same time, keeping these patients out of the hospita l. Please feel free to forward this email along with my contact information (cell (b) (6)) -- I would be happy to provide a demo to anyone who may be interested. ----- Thank you again, Greg Greg O'Keeffe President & CEO Human Resolution Technologies, LLC www .PatientMonitor ing.com Linkedln The information contained in this e-mail is legally privi leged and confidential information intended only for the use of the individual or entity to whom it is addressed.

It 's hard to believe so many years have passed since our time work ing avian influenza preparedness. I have watched every single interview during the past few months and I could not be more relieved to see you at the helm of this new, rapidly evolving crisis. I know you have very little time, so I will make this quick - hopefully to be followed by a more fulsome and proper hello. We have a prominent American businessman (age 64) here in Munich who tested positive a little over a week ago after skiing in the Dolomites in Italy. He has a history of respiratory illnesses, including double pneumonias and various other similar complications. In short, he is sedated and intubated , and was placed on ECMO during the past 24 hours. The team is administering ritonavir and lopinavir, as well as broad spectrum antibiotics. The German docto r here would like to acquire Remdesivir to have on hand if all other treatments fail. Because it is not being tested here, he inquired whether we could access it in the States. Would you be able to point me in the right direction for how, if even possible, we could transfer some to the Munich-based hospital here? Thank you so much in advance. Any other insights of course are certainly welcome. You continue to be a national treasure. All the best - Rita NIH-000733

Tony is doing a media blitz (Sean Hannity on Fox right now) but I'm sure he will check in - and I would imagine that VP Pence will turn to him to decide how to respond to Bill's phone call. Doctor-based testing capability in the US has gone up substantially in the last couple of days - after admittedly a rocky start. But home testing presents a novel detection scheme. I assume from what you say that false negat ives are uncommon and false positives are rare? NIH-000736 

For Africa, this seems like a technology that ought to be deployed as soon as possible. It astounds me that there are no documented cases in East Africa yet-that defies everything we know about air traffic with China. Providing an opportunity for low -tech testing in Addis, or Kampala, or Nairobi, or Dar es Salaam seems like a highly desirable outcome. My two cents.

As you might be aware, we have been running an influenza transmission study in Seattle for the last 2 years. This involves at-home testing for ILi-symptomatic individuals (who log-in via a web app) and collection of nasal swabs, which are then sequenced for a range of respiratory pathogens . Dan can give you more details on this study if you have questions. When the Coronavirus situation arose, we added this to the list of pathogens and hence were able to detect some of the early cases in Washington. The CDC has been very interested in the approach and at one point we had the highest screening capacity in the US (though only 400 samples per day, so I hope this is no longer true). At the same time, we have developed a COVID-19 at-home screening and information system with robust software that approximates what China was doing but also takes into account the opt-in requirements that are necessary in the US. We want to propose going beyond the Seattle area- this would be gated only by availability of testing. We can deploy this ready-now system more broadly in the US. Ideally we would also do a parallel outreach to some African countries. I'd be interested in your views and would be happy to jump on a quick call.

Subject: CoV collaboration with Polish Medical Research Agency Dear Dr. Sierpinski, Dr. Fauci referred your message to me and other NIAID colleagues with a request that we respond on his behalf so as to avoid further delay. We certa inly sympathize with your situation, as we also are working urgently to prevent, control and manage COVID-19 in the United States. During his visit to NIH in 2018, I was pleased to meet Minister Szumowski and, although I was traveling when you visited Dr. Fauci last year, I am aware that the meeti ng was productive and that we remain interested in encouraging further U.5.-Poland scientific collaboration . In part , as a result of that meeting, w e are also very pleased to be planning an NIH and ABM-sponsored clinical research training workshop in Poland later this year . As you are likely aware, NIAID is collaborating with a number of organizations to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We are expecting the first vaccine to start Phase I trials within the next month . As vaccines move through Phase I testing, there may be opportunities to collaborate . In addition , with NIAID as the regulatory sponsor, we have initiat ed a randomized, controlled clinical tria l to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational antiviral NIH-000750 

remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. This adaptive design trial will allow for the addition of new treatment arms as promising new therapeutics for COVID-19 become available. Eventually, this trial may be expanded to include international sites, potent ially includ ing some that have been affiliated with our INSIGHT Network in the past. Three sites in Poland have part icipated in INSIGHT trials: Site Name: Wroclawsk ie Centrum Zdrowia (Wroclaw) Sit e Leader: Brygida Knysz Site Name: Wojewodzki Szpital Zakazny (Warsaw) Sit e Leader: Andrzej Jerzy Horban Site Name: Uniwersytecki Szpital Kliniczny (Bialystok) Site Leader: Robert Flisiak It might be a good idea to let any Polish sites/investigators considering participation in this trial know that ABM might have available funding to support international collaborat ive research, if that is the case. This may be importan t info rmation as Polish scientists interact with other European scientists considering the development of a multi-site clinical tr ial. In addition, there may be other opportunities for collaborative research engaging Polish Institutions with access to COVID-19 patients, particula rly through the sharing of biolog ical samples and research data. Another approach would be for interested Polish scientists to explore shared interests with U.S. colleagues who are planning to apply for COVID-19 funding in response to current Funding Opportunity Announcements in the NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts. To do what we can to facilitate possible collaborations, we would also welcome receiving additional information on specific COVID-19 research interes ts, capabi lities and activities current in Poland. Thank you again for reaching out to Dr. Fauci. We look forward to continuing to discuss potent ial areas of collaboration. Best regards, F.

The fact that China has a larger percen tage of smokers in its population may have something to do with the faster spreading of the virus there. Male smoke rs out number females by a huge number and are there fore dying in much higher numbers because of that fact. Has anyone at CDC look ed into when a pe rson is around cigarette smokers that the particles of smoke land onto a persons clothing . That person then comes home with those smoke particles on their clothing and they can be shed when the clothes are removed from their body thus placing the possible virus laden particles back into the air at home to infect others. Just smell your clothes the next day and you can no doubt sme ll smoke on them . Has this case in point been looked into as a possible means of spreading the virus? Since a side effect of the virus is the patient developing pneumonia wou ld giving an elderly person the Prevar 13 shot help streng then their immune system before the virus ever strike s them? I wish you &other virologist God Speed with finding a vacc ine that will stop the spread of this epidemic. Dan iel Ga non (b)(6) NIH-000761

This question I have re lates to the current Coronavirus circu lating around the world. For many years I have infom1ed people that the ways a virus can be passed from person to person isn't always by a sneeze, cough or by touching someones face with their hands. Has anyone in your medica l community thought tha t if someone were smok ing and was an infected person that once they expel the smoke particles into the air tha t those micro smoke particles may contain vi.ruses tha t were in the respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone I mention this to don 't believe that this is possib le. What are your thoughts on this matter? If so why hasn't the medical community warned the public about this possibility as I stay away from all establishments that allow smoking on their premises. Thank you, Daniel Gagnon (b)( 6) NIH-000762

First of all I would like to thank you for your realist ic comments around the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. I am glad to see that not everyone is presenting a "Spanish Flu"- like scenario. I am reaching out to you b/c I am noticing that so many people including professionals (MD's!) appear to be think ing that people with a coronavirus infection are dying from a cytokine storm whereas my understanding is that pneumonia (whethe r viral or bacterial) is generally the underlying of the lung failure. My question to you is: Do we know whether people that have previously received a pneumococcal vaccinat ion might be better protected from death after contracting a severe coronavirus infection? i.e., would it be possible that the coronavirus causes tissue damage resulting in a secondary pneumococcal infection? I know bette r than anyone (afte r work ing over 15 years on Flublok approval) that it is not realistic to expect a coronavirus anytime soon but if we could message that a pneumococcal vaccine could be beneficial in ultimate outcome it would be good for vaccines in general as we do have pneumovax and Prevnar available. Thank you for your consideration. NIH-000763

Updates about what Americans should do to keep safe, and understanding what may be deemed risky for personal and community health, are greatly needed in these days of information (and possibly misinformation) overload. Giving American people current information and clear, updated guidance is the best way to create grassroots, coordinated, widespread effort, while the CDC, NIH, and other government health organizations organize the tops-down approaches to regional screening, emergency care, and COVID-19 research/testing for hopeful vaccination or treatment protocols . I'm very relieved and assured to have strong voices of reason, experience, and merit helping 'us' navigate these murky waters . I'm grateful for your courage. Thank you again.

At this early stage , you may agree that it is possible that containment and/or mitigation will not completely solve the current pandemic . Instead, effect ive treatmen t or amelioration of the worst complications is necessary. 1n this spirit, I have an idea that was spurred by a letter in Lancet last month authored by Al Benevolent (attached ). In this communication they suggest that baricitinib (Oluminant ; a JAK 1/2 inhibitor registered by Lilly for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), using in silico techniques . might be useful in the treatment adva nced COVID - 19 pneumon ia/ ARDS identified . Baric itinib could possibly blunt the cytokine storm seen in the most severely affected patients via inhibiti on of JA K 1 /2, but also decrease viral entry in A T2 pulmonary cells and myocard ial cells via inhibition ofGAK and AAKI. It is has a relatively short plasma half-life and hence could be more useful than Roche 's tocilizumab / Actemra). Baricitinib has a good safety profile although as a drug to treat autoimmunity it is fonnally contraindicated in patients with infections, this could be offset by treatment patients with anti-viraJs such as Gilead's remdesivir, etc. Perhaps you folks have already thought about/discus sed its use but if not J' d like a chance to chat about my additional thoughts.

Now the United States is in the acceleration phase and cases, clusters, and large outbreaks will occur in many parts of the country. I outl ine steps we can take to reduce the harms. The core concept to protect the most vulnerable. First, restrict visits to nursing homes. All of us can play a part reducing infections. Medically vulnerable people can protect themselves by reducing social contacts . I'm not sure I'd go quite as far as my good friend Bill Schaffner and say they should become semi-hermits . but that 's certainly a helpful frame of reference. Health care needs to get much safer, and ready to surge safely. And we need to stop mass gatherings, consider telework, figure out whether closing schools will help, and more.

I'm putting together the first offering of CLCH 300: Communicating Science, as part of the University of Pennsylvania's new online Certificate in Climate Change. {https :ij lpsonline.sas.upenn.edu/academ ics/certificates/climate -change) A brief recorded conversation with you about your strategies for communicating without being patronizing would be most enlightening for my students .

I think they wou ld love to hear from a scientist who is so good at communicating his field of study to diffe rent audiences. And let's face it, as soon as you say "NIH" as COVI0-19 swirls around the globe, their ears will certainly perk up! I think the students would find our interview very engaging and informative . The first run of the course will be from May 26 to July 20, 2020, but we can record the interview (on line) any time, since I know you are already over-extended right now . I think 15 minutes would be plenty, and I would be happy to send you questions that I plan to use to guide the conversat ion in advance. If a synchronous conversation is impossible given your schedule, I would be happy to just send you a couple of questions and ask you to use them to guide a 10-15 minute video that you record yourself .

Dr. Fauci, how are you sir? Long ago, in the early 90's, I was a post-doctoral fe llow in the Laboratory of Viral and Molecular Pathogenesis at NIH. I don't know if the same lab is still there. Now I work on brain injury and Alzheimer's but my interest in viruses and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis has not waned and the recent covid-19 outbreak prompted me to do a little investigation on my own. My studies of blood microRNA changes after TBI and AD suggest that principal component analysis of distinct changes in circulating miRNAs can identify the patient population. MicroRNA alterations can be measured by real-time PCR which I presume is the basis of the test that is developed for this disease but I am analyzing blood mi RNA-seq expression profiles and now it is possible to quickly sequence blood samples in a few hours and get accurate results. Blood gene expression in my studies was more variable (lots of RNases in blood) so I found that microRNAs are much more stable in blood and serum samples. I attach an example of a PCA/hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis of a GEO dataset for MERs-coV from 2016 https ://www .ncbi.n lm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8l852 I performed the PCA and heatmap analyses at two differen t stringencies and you can see that the patients can be unequivocably distinguished from the controls at very significant p and FDR values. Just a thought but many clinical centers, hospitals, academic institutions can quickly perfo rm transcriptome-wide sequencing. Blood RNA can be isolated in 1-2 hrs, sequencing libraries made in a few hres and one mi RNA sequencing run can handle up to 48 samples and the data can be quickly analyzed. Just my two cents on how NIH could accelerate the analysis of new blood samples for this new strain of coronanvirus . You could mob ilize hundreds of sequencing centers to help in the analysis.

It has long been the policy of the California OMV that all drivers OVER 70 YEARS OLD must renew their drivers licenses IN PERSON at DMV offices. DMV offices are notorious for being extremely crowded and requiring long wait times where people are breathing on each other touching each other and undisinfected surfaces and touch screens for hours. As far as I am aware DMV offices are never sanitized so germs from thousands of people can remain there for weeks on end. This is obviously a dangerous environment for anyone in the current worldwide coronavirus emergancy yet nobody in the news media is reporting on it or even seems aware of the danger. In light of your recent statement warning people over to 60 to avoid crowds this California OMV policy seems to be incredibly irresponsi ble and even life threatening but nobody is doing anything about it. (b)(6) ""N.,... e_w_s_o_m __________ __ . Only one day earlier on March 4 California Governor Gavin declared a State of Emergency in California to prevent the spread of coronav irus. I find this situation to be utterly absurd since Newsom is allowing California citizens to be exposed to exactly the kind of coronavirus danger he claims to be preventing and apparently does not even know that the DMV is totally contradicting his emergency declaration , the CDC recommendations, the California State Health Department, the Los Ange les County Health Department, and the Pasadena City Health Department. (b)(6) I am concerned that nobody seems to see the obvious public health threat. None of the relevant public health agencies have any information about this NIH-000790 

on their websites and the California DMV website makes NO MENTION WHATSOEVER of Coronavirus as a health threat in there overcrowded offices. I would sincerely like to know what you make of this dangerous DMV policy. I also want to tell you that the Californai OMV is currently advertis ing on the radio asking even more people to crowd OMV offices in order to get the REAL ID license. REAL ID further exacerbates the danger by drawing in more than NINE MILLION Californians to leave their germs in OMV offices over 1he next few months at the exact time we are in the midst of the greatest health emergency of this century and 1he most important recommendation is to AVOID CROWDS and stay at least six feet away from other people. Try staying six feet away from anyone in a crowded OMV office where hundreds of people are stuffed in like sardines. Obviously a rational policy would be to suspend the requirement for drivers over 70 to renew in person and simply let them renew by mail until the coronavirus emergency is over. The same should be done for REAL ID. A total suspension to protect public health in a crisis is the only sane thing to do. If I were the Director of the California OMV I would close all offices immediately and disinfect every inch of them, and not reopen until the coronavirus emergency is over. I would require that all OMV business should be done by mail or internet until the coronavirus threat is over. Please tell me what you think about all this and I will forward your response to local Pasadena officials since state level officials are almost impossible to contact even in an emergency when they most need to get this kind of information from the public but apparently do not want to know about bad news. I greatly appreciate your voice of reason in these scary times. I wish the officials of the State of California were as reasonable but they are apparently oblivious to a serious and unnecessary danger being created by one of their own state agencies.

NIH-000800 By Panu W ongcha-um BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai doctors have seen success in treating severe cases of the new corona virus with combinat ion of medications for flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treattnent, they said on Sunday. The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days. The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltami vir in large doses. "This is not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours," Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich , a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters. "The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment." Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the corona virus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said. Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement. "We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs," said Somsak Akkslim , director-genera l of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu medicine Oseltamivir . Thailand has recorded 19 cases of corona virus. Of the Thai patients, eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals . 

NIH-000801 Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases. Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases," he said. (Reporting by Panu W ongcha-um; Editing by Peter Graff)

Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat the infection . In this scenario, there is a need to utilize the existing repertoire of FDA approved drugs to treat the disease. The rational selection of these drugs could be made by testing their ability to inhibit any SARS-CoV-2 proteins essential for viral life-cycle . We chose one such crucial viral protein, the papain-like protease (Plpro), to screen the FDA approved drugs in silico. The homology model of the protease was built based on the SARS-coronavirus Plpro structure, and the drugs were docked in S3/S4 pockets of the active site of the enzyme. In our docking studies, sixteen FDA approved drugs , including chloroqu ine ard formoterol, was found to bind the target enzyme with significant affinity and good geometry, suggesting their potential to be utilized against the virus.

Talked to Vincent. Attaching his manuscript, unde r review with NEJM. Vincent is available at - if you need him. How the experiments were done: (b)(6) Aerosol -A solution of live virus was made and aerosolized in a rotating drum (kee ping it in aerosol form) ; at various time point s, air was removed and amount of virus measured (using end-poin t titration on Vero cells). Surface - A base solutions of live virus was made and placed on specific surfaces (plastic, etc) and at various time points, coating was taken away and virus contained was titrated. Note t hat surface experiments with proteinaceous material (e.g., respiratory secretions) are underway, as are variations in relative humidity and temperature. How do you interpret aerosol data? Decay in aerosols occurs over three hours, so if the virus is aerosol ized (via aerosol-generat ing procedures or cough), the moment it drops below a certain threshold, it would be hard to get an infect ious dose/infection. Of course we do not actually know the infectious dose, which limits our abil ity to give firm guidance based on this data. NIH-000815 

NIH-000816 How do you interpret the surface stability data? Copper seems to have some virucidal effect, as is seen with other viruses. Plastic and stainless steel don't have much of an effect on the virus itself, and the virus persists for some time. As for cardboard, difficult to interpret because the surface absorbs a good deal, but there is some immediate decay. Should we be concerned about packages based on your data? This is of far lower concern than droplet and other fomite transm ission. Typical shipping wil l allow ample time for viral decay, and the cardboard itself seems to have some direct effect on the virus (either through absorption or other effect) . For example, in the experiment, Vincent applied lOeS viral particles/ml and it drops 2 logs to 10e3 immediate ly, ind icating that either due to absorption or direct effect on the virus . Of course, if a mail carrier coughs on a package and then someone touches it directly after, there may be a risk. The typical shipping situation is likely not a concern.

It's informal as it is not meant for publication but ju st as a concern. Since I no longe r work as a virologist, I am forma lly out of the fie ld. I am however active as chief psychiatrist in Stockholm, Sweden. If you have doubts as to my expertise as a virologist or a physician, Dr Bernard Roizman at U of C knows me very well, as M arkus Heilig does here in Sweden . "I have noticed a striking difference in mortality by Co V-19 in different countries. China and Italy have a morta lity that 's at least 6-fold higher than that in South Kor ea. So far Germany and Scandinavia , totalling over 1300 cases, have not rep orted a single death. That's over a 35-40 fold difference. Loo king at the data more closely, I have found that China and Ital y have been using the antivira l Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) extensive ly on many patients in intensive care , ju stifie d as "compassionate use" . In the epidemic areas of Italy this drug is now part of treatment guidelines for hospitalised patients , used on every single patient in "criti cal conditi on". (see attachment). The "rationale" is simp ly that the first two cases treated at the SpaHan.zan.i Hospital in Rome rec eived this dn1g, and ... we ll, actuall y surv ived. NIH-000818 

Remd esivir has never passed a Phase 3 trial, but has already made big headlines in major international newspaper s. Neither South Korea nor Germany or Scandinavian countries have yet used this drug. I unde rstand that this is a (relatively) long shot, but given the number oflive s at stake, I would recommend that a carefully scrutiny by the scientific community on the use of this drug is warranted. I have no conflict of interest. Thank you for your attention". Sincerely , Rosario Leopardi, MD, PhD Forensic Psychiatry Care Clinic ____ Cb)C6) Sweden , cell: (b)(6) Sent from Outlook NIH-000819

Thanks to DARPA &OHS S& T sponsorship in years past of ANOE developing a real time Rapid DNA microfluidics system for human identification, the ANOE group has a breakthrough for detection of COVID-19 and to the future , other emerging threat viruses. As you may know the ANOE system for human identification (e.g. CT &OHS missions) is mature and now deployed operationally/tactically by CENTCOM , DIA, the IC and used most recently by OHS in their recent test bed in EI Paso to demonstrate its effective capabilities to determine family relationship in undocumented minors. Additionally ANOE is in use by law enforcement and by officials responding to mass casual ty events (CA 2018 Camp Fire disaster , 2019 Conception dive boat fire, and the very recent 2020 tragic helicopter crash) to ID the victims . The ANOE system now provides 2 hour turnaround with no special training requirements as a stand-alone system for all the above users .

First responders can then treat patients before doctors and nurses and also instead of having the patient make an appointment Or having them wa it in line for a shot, which can ultimately cause more spread . This me thod that will enable the EMS teams of the nation to combat outbreaks because you would allow EMT (Emergency Medical Technicians) and Paramedics to diffuse situations through our Ambulances.

Instead of people going to the hospital or urgent care. Each county health department needs to have a direct number of a national number that distributes information to local county governmen t health department. If you are sick and show or exhib it signs of the coronavirus you shou ld call the appropriate number , a technician will come to your home, draw lab specimen needed. Of course if someo ne is extremely ill they shou ld call 9 11 and advise 911 they are exhib iting signs of the virus. The re sho uld be special protocols in p lace for how to transport the patient into the hosp ital as well ( to limit exposure to everyone involved. This means finding alternat ive entrance at hospi tals for a suspected coronavirus patient. These patients shou ld be brought in by a least used location of the hospital into a spec ial unit that has a barrier from the rest of the emergency department. Home lab work will keep someone from sitting in a waiting room for 3_ 5 hours. The county unit to conduct lab wo rk will act in response much like calling 911 or the po lice. Each hospital needc; to set up an emergency entran ce for Coronavirus patients only, and the unit must be sealed from the remainder of the unit. We begin having a coronavirus team that does not cross contaminate to any other unit on the emergency room floor. I am thinking of the best plausible way to minin1ize outbreak. This helps.

After nearly 50 years of continuous research from my original AI09484 grant studying viral pathogenesis[ acute and persistent infections] using the LCMV model, I decided to close my laboratory. I have had other generous NIH support as well especially for investigations of other negative strand viruses[ primarily measles and influenza, Lassa ,arenavirus receptor] , Ebola, cytokine storm and autoimmun ity. The AI09484 grant was credited by 300 peer reviewed papers, training of 61 postdoctoral fellows[ including Rafi Ahmed , Christine Biron, Persephone Borrow, Ray Welsh, Ian Lipkin, Dorian McGavern and other successes including the late Patrick Sissons who was the Reagent Professor of Medicine at Cambridge. Over 85% of these folk are in academic medicine/b iology at research institutes or universities. Good luck and smooth sailing with the current coronavirus pandemic. With your involvement this work is in good hands . Best wishes Michael NIH-000836

Traul (b) (6) Sent: Saturday, March 7, 2020 4:42 PM ------ == To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E] (b)(6) -------- Subject: Corona Virus planning Dear Dr. Fauci; I am a toxicologist and have spent time, years ago, working in the arena of oncogenic virology as part of NCI programs. I am very concerned about what I see in the news media about the NIH approach to the COVID-19 pandemic (yes, pandemic) that has arrived in our country. There is much talk about development of a vaccine , however , I believe that this is a long-term strategy. You and I both know, from working as scientists, that the development and trial of an antiviral vaccine is a months-long program, at best. I am surprised, even disappointed , that there seems to be no visible focus on the part of the NIH on the development of anti-viral treatments (drugs etc) . It is my professional opinion that anti-virals would take a shorter time to develop than vaccines, yet it appears that this may be a back burner focus of NIH. I realize that there are many political pressures on your office and I support your strong efforts to apply science to the resolution of this growing problem . Please do not give short shrift to the potential of antiviral treatments in favor of the longer-term promise of a vaccine. Respectfully yours, Karl A. Traul K.A. Traul , Ph.D. K.A.

I live in CbH KS. For the past 35 years I have been a Purchasing Agent in the private sector. Much of my career has dealt with China sourcing and supplier development. I have established a wide network of suppliers and contacts throughout China. You can see from my US Passport number CbH6) that I have traveled to China for the past 20 years ... including spending nearly CbH6J my time in 2018 & 2019 visiting China suppliers . (Thankfully I returned on 15-Nov-2019 , prior to the outbreak... CbH6).) I was invited by one of my trusted suppliers to offer One Step COV ID-19 test kits to the United States. The Guangzhou based s~as CbH4> test kits available now for immediate shipment. They can produce ~ kits per week at their factory . Please see the information below and the materials attached for more information. This is a very cost effective test - and provides results in 15 minutes. I will trust you to determine the efficacy of the diagnostics. To be clear - this is not my business. I will profit in no way from providing these kits to the American healthcare public -- except for the sat isfaction of doing my patriotic duty to assist my fellow Americans. I fully understand the gravity and seriousness of this disease. All of my factories in China have, and are , suffering from the effect and fall out. My business in CbH6) is dealing with the effects of the supply chain disruptions. I hope that this offer , and availability of a additional test kit pipeline, will help ease the test kit shortage that we are experiencing in the USA . If you and your Procurement NIH-000848 

Offices would like more information or would like to secure these test kits, please contact me. I can assist in arranging supplier contacts and immediate air shipments.

Why not try giving those with active disease, or those at risk, gamma-globu lin, to ameliorate the effects of the il lness? It would be especially interesting to prepare batches of gamma globulin using the blood (2,000- 3,000 dono rs) of people who have, or who have recovered from, COVID-19 infection. There is ample precedent for using Gamma-globulin to prevent or treat viral illnesses (Hepatitis A, B) or diseases of unknown etiology (ie Kawasaki's). This could be useful especially while we wait for the development of a vaccine. What do you think?

(There is too much yahoo-machismo in our field) Please put forth recommendations for providers and their employe rs. 2) I see the CDC warning about herbals, which I agree with except for one: echinacea, just about the only herbal with proven medical usefulness, not as it is recommended on the bottles or websites, but as only a single 2 capsules, on day one of viral illness. Echinacea demarginates the matured bone marrow leukocytes. Used as a "one shot deal" may decrease COVID-19 duration/severity as eg.: "take right away on day one, drink plenty of water and sleep as long as necessary". Please at least study the use of Echinacea in this manner for COVID-19. (Google is suddenly missing Echinacea's mechanism/use info, so please have this corrected, if for nothing else to prevent hoarding. One bottle can be for a whole neighborhood and please ask the drug stores to offer "two packs" with proper instructions. eg.: "take only two as soon as ill with cold or flu and not take more, but to replenish the immune system follow up with fresh fruits and vegetables, etc . 3) Make sure we have enough Ventolin, Proventil available so those with new asthmatic component due to COVID-19 can call their Dr. for RX if they cannot blow out a match, for instance, and use th e drive through instead of goin into the pharmacy. Consider hazmat for drive through testing and Rx pharmacy staff (as in S. Korea). I would be interested in knowing the percent of COVID-19 respiratory sufferers who can stay home but will need Ventolin.10%? (just a guess from seeing bronchitis in the ER). NIH-000854 

4) Ensure all the medical providers with offices, give out their office telephone numbers and have staff trained to triage calls so people can stay home until they are well. 5) Ensure levothyroxine (the US most common Rx) is made in the USA from ingred ients made in the USA. Ditto for down the line of the most necessary and common RX, including Ventolin, and the antibiotics that would treat bacterial superinfection of COVID-19 (particularly the ones that can be used at home: macrolides, etc.) 6) Encourage prevention of superinfection with clean respiratory toilet, hydration, chest PT preferred over suctioning, clean environment, including cleaning floors daily. One of the most successful methods of chest PT involves the patient lying on the bed with their face near the floor. Decreasing the load of pulmonary sputum is critical. 7) There is very large number of semi-retired physicians, such as myself who would probably like to be utilized (an paid a little) for te lemedicine to assist with triage. We can do telemedicine at home. I am not set up to do this but will soon be set up and able. We need to know which companies we can trust to hire us. There should be telemedicine training and tracking coming from t he CDC or other state and national governments. 8) Is the 3/3/20 John Kehoe Financial Times art icle correct? Is it not best to predict mortality so as to more realistically prepare for post-COVID-19 recovery economically and socially and give confidence by being transparent? I see recovery jobs being the young taking care of the old after most have had it and been cured or succumbed. Then the other half of the people will get it, too ... Is there some stigma attached to the word "infrastructure" that would prevent recovery of our economy? 9) I do not wee the recommendations for Flu and both pneumovax vaccines, but the recommendation needs to get out broadly right away. 10) Wuhan had to truck in food ... how are we planning? Canned food decreases one's immu ne system. Fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen or dried are needed. 11) China closed all the theaters ... and we should also start closing the use of public places, particularly asking folks in their 60's and older to stay home now. 12) Recommend providers write three month supply of Rx for all patients, to decrease visits out and ensure availability. 13) The closure of schools might spread COVID-19 unless children have food to eat at home and the parents comply. 14) Will census takers spread it? Should the census be postponed or performed via hazmat suit or in another fashion? This is a long list. Please look into 2-packs of Echinacea with instructions . Get enough sleep/stay wel l.

I share one such thought with you here. Several years ago, recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rHGH) was reported to be significantly effective in restoring/ enhancing T cell anti -viral activity in patients infected with HlV (citation below): Growth hormone resurrects adult human thymus during HIV-1 infection Kiki Tesselaar, Frank Miedema J Cf in In vest. 2008; 118(3):844-847. http s://doi.org/1 0. l 172/JCI351 l 2. My thought is that since, in many ways, elderly patients afflicted with COVID-19 fall into a similar category, that treatment with NIH-000857 

NIH-000858 rHGH might be an effective treatment alternative to employ during this immediate time frame while you are exploring more specific alternatives. I look forward to your thoughts on this, and best wishes, David (PS: I think you have handled yourself magnificently during these incredible press conferences, etc.!)

I have a concern about the universities and the spread of this virus . Many schools brought back students from study abroad before the 14 day quarantine was put into place, and even after the quarantine was put in place, many students did not follow the quarantine rules. Also, with shared dorms and apartments it was not possible for student's who returned to campuses and not their homes. By the times schools came up with a plan for quarantining the student's it was well over a week after some were back. Therefore, there is potential for widespread infection. The vice president said the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are at risk and should take caution in where they go, avoid crowded places etc..Millions of students have asthma, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, and they do not have a choice other than to go to class. The government does not seemed concerned about the potential spread among campuses and what a disaster this could be. They have voiced why grade schools are not closed (since younger are not at risks better for them to be at school) but they are ignoring college kids are at risk and the impact of widespread infection on a campus could be huge. Students i~ colleges travel back and forth to the city all the time , and I am concerned schools are not temporarily closing until more testing is available and we see where this goes. At minimum , giving student's with underlying medical conditions the option to go home and work remotely. Right now they do not have NIH-000870 

any option other than to go to class. When questioned they say they are listening to the CDC and state government. (b)(6) and students are not following the advice to stay home sick and nobody seems concerned about trying to prevent infection. Can the government please look at a temporary ban on classes at Universit ies in states where infection is rapidly spreading, especially knowing there are not enough test available yet. The schools are not taking action on their own and this is a frustrating situation seeing delays in decisions making.

I am a pediatrician in Massachusetts, and as you know , direct-linkage from travel cases are popping up on the East Coast. In order to keep the community viral load down, keeping new cases from moving around the country and the world will delay the spread and amplification of the viral load. According to my observations, hot climates seem to be having a favorable new case rate . Based on the city of Qom versus the experience in Singapore and Australia, it appears that the transit ion temperature for efficient spread is somewhere above when there are highs around 50 degrees F, similar to H1 N1. According to my observations, prior to seasonal flu, the transition temperature was closer to highs of 40 degrees F. This theory should be testable . For example , there are new cases in Kuwait and Bahrain. If I am right , if you tested a subset of these populations , you would find a very high rate of asymptomatic infection, probably 80-90%, because that's how many people it would take to shed small amounts of virus to create a community viral load to make someone sick enough to get tested. If this is true , this bodes well for the virus burning itself out to endemic status relatively quickly. This would be very reassuring data you could provide to reduce panic - if you can tell people you know how long this pandemic is going to last rather than saying that we don't know. Although some experts may say that restricting travel will only delay the inevitable, this is not a valid statement if the transition temperature for effect spread really is 50 degrees. A delay of significant community spread in the US until highs reach the 50s for the Northeast where the population is the most NIH-000874 

NIH-000875 dense would have a massive life-saving effect , but if this is to occur, the flight restriction needs to happen now. Stopping all flights would be impractical and inhumane, but allowing return flights only and stopping all other air travel would be effective . It would have a massive effect on the economy, but so will overwhelming corona virus infection. No one will die because they can't take a vacation or business trip. Financial losses would need to be settled later, so this would require emergency declarations , etc. If you wanted to take it in a step-wise manner , you could start with international flights and then move on to domestic flights if necessary - this would probably be wise and would have a less severe impact on the economy.

Our SARS study (JID 2006, 193:1244-1249; see the attachmen t) showed selective expansions of Vy9Vo2 T cells in survivors of SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly , stimulated Vy9V62 T cells also display an interferon-y-dependent anti-SARS-CoV activity and are able to directly kill SARS-CoV-infected cells. Since it is very easy to activate human Vy9Vo2 T cells in vivo (e.g., using FDA-approv ed and relatively non-toxic drugs for treating bone-demineraliza tion) and given the simi larities between SARS￾CoV and SARS-CoV-2, I thought that it could be potentially useful to bring these facts to your and Tony's attention , in spite of knowing that both of you are probably slightly busier these days than you would like to be.

In this way the present conoravirus infection is very like our present and previous fatal influenza virus infections. In the 1918 pandemic many if not most of the fatal cases were caused by bacterial superinfection with hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci. The former is rather se ldom now, but the pneumococcal infections are common.

While not doubting the reality of this genetic variability , best observed in an orderly manner in the case of HIV, I considered the possibility that these pathogens are endowed wiith an immunosuppressive capacity that is not inactivated during vaccine production, and that current vaccines do not induce immunity against such immunosuppression. I applied this reasonning when I worked on an AIDS vaccine in 1991 in Zagury's lab (Halbreich A et al. (1992) Vaccine Research,4 :397-412 ). Indeed, we tested then , in suitably immunized animals , the effect of the various preparations on the cellular response to tuberculin and the capacity of animals to be Immunized against tuberculin and tetanus as a function of the exrent of treatment. The immune response to these agents was indeed higher in the presence of hivions compared to heat inactivated preparations . This HIVION preparat ion was used on 6 patients in Zaire (Zagury et al. ( 1992) J Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 5 :676-681). NIH-000890 

Unfortunately, when I tried to make a greater prep for a phase I trial, the viral preparation turned out (too late), by SOS gel elecrophoresis , not to contain any viral protein, due either to degradat ion or another mishap . I left Zagury 's lab soon after and it was impossib le for me later to obtain material (either viral or from recombinant protein) to further advance the matter. I do believe that tuning vaccine preparation to counter immunosuppressive effect of the virus (parasite) while preserving its capacity to induce anti viral immunity should resolve the need to revaccinate every year against the same virus. In fact, identifying the epitopes , acting for immunity and those acting against immunosuppression, at a later stage should allow a better result than we obtained. (It is not yet known whether corona virus also mutates rapidly, but I heard that a woman was reinfected after having recovered from covid-19 infection and this might indicate a capacity of the virus to counteract the host's immune response. In CbH6) I have been itching ever since to go back to unfinished projects , but did not find an avenue. Now, with the outburst of the corona virus pandemic this surfaces again .

WASHINGTON (JTA) - The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said that at least two people who attended the lobby's policy conference have tested positive for the . coronaVIrus. The conference, which ran from Feb. 28-March 2, drew 18,000 activists to Washington. The AIPAC statement posted late Friday on Twitter said the two people who tested positive are from New York. The outbreak has been especially hard on the Orthodox Jewish community in Westchester County, and AIP AC listed the county's health department as among the authorities with which it is in communication. The others are the New York Health Department, national health authorities and the District of Columbia Health Department. The statement also said the lobby was consulting with Edward Septimus, a professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M University. The statement posted on Twitter said an email was going out to all attendees as well as to congressional offices. The conference routinely attracts a majority of Congress members and their staffers.

I believe that prevention is much more important than treatment later. As a preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak, two days ago, I made a personal decision to make all my homework on line submission so that we may avoid the spread of the virus anymore . Students work on homework for hours and can easily spread the virus without knowing it. Once it goes to graders (my TAs), they then spread it to the rest of the class, again without knowing it. Thus, an innocent act can be devastat ing. So, in simply two-three days it may spread to another 100 new indiv iduals easily. Graders may act as hubs in this case. The danger is, it may have spread to another hundred or more new individua ls even before it comes to a detectable level from any test. I also want to emphasis the following points: 1. We hear in all news that elderly people are the most vulnerable. But I think it should be corrected as people with immunodeficiency are the most vulnerable and elderly are in that category. Some one who is 10 years old and have diabetic or HIV has the same danger as an elderly person . 2. We should come up with a test such as a pregnancy test, which can be done at home without leaving their homes. This stops further spreading. 3. We should discuss foods that help cure it fast and th ings that we should not do. NIH-000899 

I have shared my thoughts with CNN (Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper as well). Thank you for your time and everything you do to our community at this critical moment .

My early academic research (reference provided, PNAS) involved cancer immunology where it contributed to a growing body of information that certain tumor cells could possess unique surface antigens that could be used for immunologi c therapy (https://www .pnas.org/co ntent/pnas/7S/12/S9 12.full.pdf). My career then too k me to executive and senior executive/corporate officer positions in publicly-held pharmaceutical corporations (Glaxo and Salix, respectively) overseeing R&D of therapeutic agents. My experience has included both pharmaceuticals and biologics. (b)(6) Our current understanding of COVID-19 mortality is that it appears to be concentrated in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. In healthy indiv iduals (although still early) it appears that many of NIH-0009 11 

those infected with SARS-CoV-2 may remain symptom free or develop mi ld disease, or recover from more severe illness. Currently there are tens of thousands of individua ls who have been identified as having been infected but are considered 'recovered' . That being case it wou ld seem plausible that they have mounted an antibody response to the virus. The question is whethe r these individua ls are being tested for ant ibody titre to the virus, and if that is occurring whethe r they are being approached to donate plasma to move into lglv production. With this illness still in it s early stages and being international, I would imagine that such an effort would involve a public/private sector endeavor. Understanding the difficulty in developing a vaccine for 'cold viruses', lvlG may be a way to at least reduce the mortality in our most vulne rable patients . So, the slow start we have had in t esting the US population for this virus goes beyond disease prevention - it would certa inly be affecting our ability, to some degree, of rapidly developing a more targeted intervention for high risk patients . Again, you may have already thought of this, but as a concerned citizen having some background and an (b)(6) ,I wanted to share these thoughts .

Here's what he saw. NIH-0009 14 

Dr. Bruce Aylward, leader of the W.H.O. team that visited China to assess the country's response to the coronavirus outbreak.Cred it ... Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone , via Associated Press By Donald G. McNeil Jr. • March 4, 2020 As the leader of the World Health Organization team that visited China, Dr. Bruce Aylward feels he has been to the mountaintop - and has seen what's possible. During a two -week visit in early February, Dr. Aylward saw how China rapidly suppressed the coronavirus outbreak that had engulfed Wuhan, and was threatening the rest of the country . New cases in China have dropped to about 200 a day, from more than 3,000 in early February. The numbers may rise again as China's economy begins to revive . But for now, far more new cases are appearing elsewhere in the world. China's counterattack can be replicated, Dr. Aylward said, but it wil l requi re speed, money, imagination and political courage. For countries that act quickly, containment is sti ll possible ''because we don't have a global pandemic - we have outbreaks occurring globally," he added. NIH-000915 

NIH-000916 Dr. Aylward, who has 30 years experience in fighting polio, Ebola and other global health emergencies, detailed in an interview with The New York Times how he thinks the campaign against the virus should be run . This conversation has been edited and condensed. Do we know what this virus's lethality is? We hear some estimates that it's close to the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed 2.5 percent of its victim s, and other s that it's a littl e worse than the seasonal flu, which kills only 0.1 percent. How many cases are missed affects that . There's this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases. Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two. In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province . (Covid-19 is the medical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.) There is no evidence that we' re seeing only t he tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus. What we're seeing is a pyram id: most of it is aboveground. Once we can test anti bodies in a bunch of people, maybe I'll be saying, "Guess what? Those data didn't tell us the story ." But the data we have now don't support it. That's good, if there' s little asymptomatic tr ansmission. But it's bad in that it implies that the death rates we've seen - from 0.7 percent in parts of China to 5.8 percent in Wuhan - are correct, right? I've heard it said that "t he mortali ty rate is not so bad because the re are actually way more mild cases." Sorry - the same number of people th at were dying, still die. The real case fatality rate is probably what it is outside Hubei Province, somewhere between 1 and 2 percent.

NIH-000917 What about children? We know they are rarely hospitalized . But do they get infected? Do they infect their families? We don't know. That Guangdong survey also turned up almost no one under 20. Kids got flu, but not this. We have to do more studies to see if they get it and aren't affected, and if they pass it to family members . But I asked dozens of doctors : Have you seen a chain of transmission where a child was the index case? The answer was no. Why? There's a theory that youngsters get the four known mild coronaviruses so often that they 're protected. That's still a theory. I couldn't get enough people to agree to put it in t he W.H.O. report . Does that imply that closing schools is pointle ss? No. That's still a question mark . If a disease is dangerous, and you see clusters, you have to close schools. We know that causes problems, because as soon as you send kids home, half your wor k force has to stay home to take care of them. But you don't take chances with children . Are the cases in China really going down? I know there 's suspicion, but at every testing clinic we went to, people would say, "It's not like it was three weeks ago." It peaked at 46,000 people asking for tests a day; when we left, it was 13,000. Hospitals had empty beds. I didn't see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers. A rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued, and come down faster than would have been expected . Back of the envelope, it's hundreds of thousands of people in China that did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response. Is the virus infecting almost everyone, as you would expect a novel flu to? No - 75 to 80 percent of all clusters are in families. You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or prisons, but the vast majority are in families. And only 5 to 15 percent of your close contacts develop disease. So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible, and find everyone you had contact with in 48 hours before that. You said differ ent cities responded differently. How? It depended on whether they had zero cases, sporadic ones, clusters or widespread transmission. First, you have to make sure everyone knows the basics: hand-washing, masks, not shaking hands, what the symptoms are. Then, to find sporadic cases, they do fever checks everywhere, even stopping cars on highways to check everyone. As soon as you find clusters, you shut schools, theaters, restaurants. Only Wuhan and the cities near it went into total lockdown. How did the Chinese reorganize their medical response? First, they moved 50 percent of all medical care on line so people didn't come in. Have you ever tried to reach your doctor on Friday night? Instead, you contacted one online. If you needed prescriptions like insulin or heart medications, they could prescribe and deliver it.

They would take your temperature, your symptoms, medical histo ry, ask where you'd traveled, your contact with anyone infected. They'd whip you through a CT scan ... Wait - "whip you through a CT scan"? Each machine did maybe 200 a day. Five, 10 minutes a scan. Maybe even partial scans. A typical hospital in the West does one or two an hour. And not X-rays; they could come up normal , but a CT would show the "ground-glass opacities" they were look ing for . (Dr. Aylward was referring to lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients .) And then? If you were still a suspect case, you'd get swabbed. But a lot would be told , "You're not Covid." People would come in with colds, flu, runny noses. That's not Covid. If you look at the symptoms, 90 percent have fever, 70 percent have dry coughs, 30 percent have malaise, trouble breathing. Runny noses were only 4 percent. The swab wa s for a PCR test, right? How fast could they do that? Until recently , we were sending all of ours to Atlanta. They got it down to four hours. So people weren't sent home? No, they had to wait . You don't want someone wandering around spreading virus. If they were positive, what happened ? They'd be isolated. In Wuhan, in the beginning, it was 15 days from getting sick to hospitalization . They got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation . That meant a lot fewer infected - you choke off this th ing's ability to find susceptibles . What' s the difference between isolation and hospitalization? 

NIH-000919 With mild symptoms, you go to an isolation center. They were set up in gymnasiums, stadiums - up to 1,000 beds. But if you were severe or critical, you'd go straight to hospitals. Anyone with other illnesses or over age 65 would also go straight to hospitals. What were mild, severe and critical? We think of "mild" as like a minor cold. No. "Mild" was a positive test, fever, cough - maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen. "Severe" was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. "Critical" was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure. So saying 80 percent of all cases are mild doesn't mean what we thought . I'm Canadian. This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses - people didn't think it was big enough or fast enough to have the impact it does. A sports stadium converted to a makeshift hospital in Wuhan, China.Credit...China Daily/Reuters Hospitals were also separated? Yes. The best hospitals were designated just for Covid, severe and critical. All elective surgeries were postponed. Patients were moved . Other hospitals were designated just for routine care: women still have to give birth, people still suffer trauma and heart attacks. They built two new hospitals, and they rebuilt hospitals. If you had a long ward, they'd build a wall at the end with a window, so it was an isolation ward with "dirty" and "clean" zones. You'd go in, gown up, treat patients, and then go out the other way and de-gown . It was like an Ebola treatment unit, but without as much disinfection because it's not body flu ids. How good were the severe and critical care? China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some I see here in Switzerland. We'd ask, "How many ventilators do you have?" They'd say "50 ." Wow! We'd say, "How many ECMOs?" They'd say "five ." The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, "Five? In Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin." 

(ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, which oxygenate the blood when the lungs fail.) Who paid for all of thi s? The governmen t made it clear: testing is free. And if it was Covid-19, when your insurance ended, the state picked up everything . In the U.S., that's a barrier to speed. People think: "If I see my doctor, it's going to cost me $100. If I end up in the I.C.U., what's it going to cost me?" That'll kill you. That's what could wreak havoc. This is where universal health care coverage and security intersect. The U.S. has to think this through. What about the non medical response? It was nationwide. There was th is tremendous sense of, "We've got to help Wuhan ," not "Wuhan got us into this." Other prov inces sent 40,000 medical workers, many of whom volunteered . In Wuhan, our special train pulled in at night, and it was the saddest thing - the big intercity tra ins roar right through, with the blinds down . We got off, and another group did. I said, "Hang on a minute, I thought we were the only ones allowed to get off ." They had these little jackets and a flag - it was a medical team from Guangdong coming in to help . How did people in Wuhan eat if they had to stay indoors? Fifteen million people had to order food on line. It was delivered. Yes, there were some screw-ups. But one woman said to me: "Every now and again there's something missing from a package, but I haven't lost any weight ." A yoga class being taught on line from a studio in Beijing.Credit ... Roman Pilipey/EPA, via Shutterstock Lots of government employ ees were reassigned? From all over society . A highway worker might take temperatures, deliver food or become a contact tracer. In one hospital, I met the woman teaching people how to gown up. I asked, "You're the infection control expert?" No, she was a receptionist. She'd learned. NIH-000920 

How did technology play a role? They're managing massive amounts of data, because they're trying to trace every contact of 70,000 cases. When they closed the schools, really, just the buildings closed. The schooling moved online. Contact tracers had on-screen forms . If you made a mistake, it flashed yellow. It was idiot-proof. We went to Sichuan, which is vast but rural. They'd rolled out SG. We were in the capital, at an emergency center with huge screens. They had a problem understanding one cluster. On one screen, they got the county headquarte rs. Still didn't solve it. So they got the field team. Here's this poor team leader 500 kilometers away, and he gets a video call on his phone, and it's the governor. What about social media? They had Weibo and Tencent and WeChat giving out accurate informat ion to all users. You could have Facebook and Twitter and lnstagram do that. Isn't all of this impossible in America? Look, journalists are always saying: "We ll, we can't do this in our country." There has to be a shift in mind-set to rapid response thinking . Are you just going to throw up your hands? There's a real moral hazard in that, a judgment call on what you think of your vulnerable popul ations. Ask yourself: Can you do the easy stuff? Can you isolate 100 patients? Can you trace 1,000 contacts? If you don't, this will roar through a community . Isn't it possible only because China is an autocracy? Journalists also say, "We ll, they're only acting out of fear of the government," as if it's some evil fire￾breathing regime that eats babies. I talked to lots of people outside the system - in hotels, on trains, in the streets at night . They're mobilized, like in a war , and it's fear of the virus that was driving them. They really saw themse lves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world. NIH-000921 

NIH-000922 A medical worker in a hospital in Wuhan working with traditional medicines to treat patients.Credit ... Agence France-Presse - Getty Images China is restarting its economy now. How can it do that without creating a new wave of infections? It's a "phased restart ." It means different things in different provinces . Some are keeping schools closed longer. Some are only letting factories that make things crucial to the supply chain open. For migrant workers who went home - well, Chengdu has 5 million migrant workers. First, you have to see a doctor and get a certificate that you're "no risk." It's good for three days. Then you take the train to where you work. If it's Beijing, you then have to self-quarantine for two weeks. Your temperature is monitored, sometimes by phone, sometimes by physical check. What's going on with the tr eatment clinical trials? They're double-blind trials, so I don't know the results. We should know more in a couple of weeks. The biggest challenge was enrolling people. The number of severe patients is dropping, and the re's competition for them. And every ward is run by a team from anothe r province, so you have to negotiate with each one, make sure they're doing the protocols right . And there are 200 trials registered - too many. I told them: "You've got to prioritize things that have promising antiviral properties." And they're te sting traditional medicines? Yes, but it's a few standard formulations. It's not some guy sitting at the end of the bed cooking up herbs. They think they have some fever -reducing or anti-inflammatory properties. Not antivirals, but it makes people feel better because they're used to it. What did you do to protect yourself? A heap of hand-sanitizer. We wore masks, because it was government policy. We didn't meet patients or contacts of patients or go into hospital dirty zones. And we were socially distant. We sat one per row on the bus. We ate meals in our hotel rooms or else one person per table. In conference rooms, we sat one per table and used microphones or shouted at each other. That's why I'm so hoarse. But I was tested, and I know I don't have Covid.

As you know, the CDC has asked all healthcare facilities to prepare for the "worst case scenario" around the Novel Coronavirus. As much of our medical supply manufacturing in the US comes from overseas, it is of critical import to look at potential shortages of key products that will be needed to perform basic IP functions in you r facility . We have already seen challen ges with N95 masks, and I have heard about potential shortages of items like disinfection wipes. We at MPI have a couple of unique solution s you need to consider: PureTabs and PureOne NaDCC tablets that are diluted in tap water to create HOCl for surface disinfection. They are currently used in electrostatic sprayers to offer greater coverage around your equipment. If, for some reason , there's a challenge getting the electrostati c sprayers in the future ( and we've already seen shortages and delays in getting new units), simply use our NaDCC tablets with spray bottle s from your local store to apply the HOCl for disinfection. Our tablets have kill claims for C. diff in four minutes, and like a number of other cleaning agents, we believe we can be effective against the Novel Coronaviru s. The prob lem with the other products out there comes down to availability, particularly of the N95 masks that are required on their IFU's. With our product, an N95 mask is recommended, but not required, which is a huge distinction if you have run out of N95 masks. Secondly , we have our protective scrub s, lab coats and privacy curtains from Prime Med ical. Co-branded with Clorox, these products create a 3 log (99.9%) barrier against bacteria and viruses when washed with bleach. The barrier lasts for 12 weeks, NIH-000926 

so there's a dramatically lower chance of passing something along. These are a great protective measure for your staff. The CDC mentioned that sodium hypochlorite (bleach) may be effective against Novel Coronavirus, so it stands to reason that our scrubs will help against unwanted spreading as well. Finally, we have our Path-0-Wrap, which protects mattresses and gurneys from the harsh chemicals used during cleaning. It also can help dramatically when a catastrophic event happens, as you simply put these on a gurney or mattress and remove them between patients. It was invented by an EMT for just this purpose , and may be exactly what you need for your Emergency Preparedness Program. We also have other great IP products such as: • UV Disinfection Boxes to create a "touch-less check-in" to protect staff and patients alike • HealthySole UV solutions for the bottom of feet for OR and other sensitive areas • Bowman Cover Your Cough Stations I have attached a couple of brochures for your review.

As part of this effort, we are assisting with developing preclinical and clinical test ing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease fol lowing vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine candidates. As you know, this had been an issue with some prior SARS vaccine candidates. We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on March 12 and 13 between 8 am and 1 pm Eastern ti me each day. Participants in the meeting are shown in the attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley Plotk in and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NHP animal models as well as appropriate immunologic testing to be done in early phase one trials. I am wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one of our formal peer reviewers. The goal of the meet ing would be to share recommendations with CEPI COVID-19 developers as well as other interested part ies. Any comments you have on the agenda or draft questions for consideration would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to hearing back from you.

It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice . • Abstract • Info/ History • Metr ics • • Preview PDF Abstract Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 vira l load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVI0-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with th e occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospita l of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatmen t of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the Natio nal Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status NIH-000935 

NIH-000936 prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation : Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeut ic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.

Best, Tony From: James Krellensteih (b)(6) sent: Wednesday, March 4, 2020 6:46 PM To: Fauci, Anthony (NIH/NIAID) [E) ______ _.,, (b.,.. )(=6) Subject: Re: 2019-nCoV Testing for Public Health Labs Tony: I am loath to contact you give n that I am sure you are overwhelmed . However, we are now being contacted by sources at tertiary academic hospita ls with CUA-high complexity clinical labs who are alarmed about their inability to scale up SARS-CoV2 qRT-PCR testing in t heir facilities in the time frame they feel is neccesary, even after Saturday's FDA regulatory guidance and the availability of Integrated DNA Technology 's testing reagents. (An example of such an email is below.) I am passing th is along with the hopes that if you can do something about it, you will. From an email: "We have experience bringing up laboratory deve loped tests. We have never submitted an EUA before. For our current LDTs, they are typically for pathogens that we have some experience with, positive clinical samples are readily available, and/or appropriate control materials (e.g. bact eria, viral genomes) are read ily commerc ially available. None of those are true for SARS-Co V2. There is tremendous concern about deploying a suboptima l test into a challenging envirom11ent. The EUA guidance from FDA is not unreasonable for the validation of a new respiratory virus test, and it gives an accurate picture of the amount of testing that is required to bring on a new test by the lab. Federal law requires us to perform accuracy, reproducib ility, analytical sensitivity / LOD, and analytical specificity (cross reactivity) studies. Those stud ies require positive contro l mater ial includingintact v irus or RNA. Clinica l labs are not prepared to generate RNA transcript, and we don't usually source these ourselves. We can't get the virus without filling out extensive paperwork that requires multiple signatures. Getting control material for validation one of the biggest issues. NIH-000949 

Prior to the EUA change, the calculus for our labs was that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to actually validate a test, and then we would submit to the FDA for EUA (a process non e of us has ever done), and then we wou ld wait for the FDA to respond (hopefu lly in the affirmative). I think we all expected the FDA EUA review to be at least 4 weeks. Based on that time-line, many commercial vendors would have reagents available with their own EU As that would be able to be performed on large automated instruments including potentially STAT. None of the LDT assays (or CDC assay) can be performed STAT or on demand. With the EUA change, the proc ess to va lidate the test is still the same and will still take 3 or more weeks. Once validated, we can perform clinical testing (like any other LDT) while we submit the EUA. This would likely allow us to begin testing several weeks before commercial vendors have EUA reagents available based upon our best current infonnation. Most of us expect to transition a commercial EUA at some point. The recent statement that IDT reage nts can be used under the EUA from CDC is misleading. It applies to a very limited number of lots ( cunently 1, likely 2 soon), it assumes reagents are available, and it requires strict adherence to the CDC protocol using identical extraction methods (2 choices) and amplification/ detection methods ( l instrument). It still specifies the use of an Nl, N2, and NJ reactions, but CDC has dropped the N3 reaction. The EUA has not yet been updated. Neither of our hospitals have the complete extract ion or amplifi cation instruments so we have to do the EUA anyway." Hope you are coping ok, James James 8.

2. Iranian cases, though mysterious since the origin was not traced to China, may very well show that COVID-19 virus is very adaptable and mutating rapidly. 3. Long recovery The long recovery period is troubesome and must be taken seriously by health providers as they prepare for hospitalization. Therei snot much surge capacity in hospitals. So they must be innoative in the staggering process and isolation is of paramount importance. Government/Local should be readied for supplementing medical tents outside hospitals when needed (clearly extra staff too) . 4. Citizes' vi ew I was traveling so I did a real-time on-the-road analysis of human behavior and anxiety level. I overheard many people -- (a) asked when CDC would tell us more on what to do. -- (b) wish they could pull their kids out of school but there is no such option as part of the preventive measure (not announced by CDC). -- (c) wish CDC wou ld recommend tele-work options so they don't have to travel and expose themselves and their family to unneccessary risk. -- (d) have no clue what the government is doing to keep the risk low as it is now. What exactly is being implemented to keep it low. 5. Resource-limit ed countri es I pray that it would not reach the resource-limited countries like many in Afri ca (though it seems unavoidable). I cannot imagine the consequence. 6. What we must do: We must leverage the knowledge from other countries to better prepare ourselves. Japan's Crusis shows the importance of TIMELY proper isolation and STRATEGIC operations logistics in testing and in quarantine . South Korea (contrasting with Hong Kong, Singapore) demonstrates critica l importance of EARLY social distancing and high compliance community NPI intervent ion. China's latest lockdown of 1/2 billion people truly signifies that gravity and unchartered terrority of this virus. No country would take to such extreme measure. 7. CFR Since over 90% of influenza is never recorded/known, this COVID-19 seems to fall into similar spirit now, with so many cases of asymptomtic and transmission while incubating . While the true CFR remains unknown, the CFR of tested positive cases should offer a good comparison to the CFR of tested positive flu cases. That gives us a clearer estimate of health-resource burden.

NIH-001469 Singapore and Hong Kong are holding steady- both have implemented NPis pretty early and have good surveillance . Things are really accelerating in South Korea. Case count increased to 433 with 2 deaths. https :/ /www .cdc. go .kr/board/board .es?mid=a30402 000000&bid=0030 Report below of COVID hitting Samsung's mobile device factory, which has now been shut down. This is what will happen here. The greatest concern is what this would mean for critical infrastructure sectors (including components of our healthcare system), The strategies I outlined for outpatient clinics could be used by business (most especially CI sectors) to maintain business continuity. It is as simple as the old saying, "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." It is both contingency planning ( continuity of operations/continuity of business) and application ofNPis/fLC (especially social distancing in the community supported by home isolation and home quarantine). We now have COVID in several countries across the ME (Iran, Israel, Egypt, Lebanon , UAE) . We added Iran the day before yesterday and 3 countries yesterday (Israel, Egypt and Lebanon). Iran already appears to have a well established outbreak that will be tough to slow down given the estimated size with 5 deaths already (that is where Wuhan was by Jan-20). Japan is also seeing acceleration with local transmission (119 cases). Italy is another area to watch. htt ps://p rotect2.fi reeye.com/ url?k=c92f3372 -957b2a0e -c92f024d￾0cc47adc5fa2- 9270 14023819d8ec&u=htt ps://www .ilgazzett ino.it/no rdest/. ..

It means that there are other people, probably among those who attended the ward where tw o patients were hospitalized , who are now positive for the virus and consequently could in turn have spread the infect ion. Already yesterday evening the Governor of Veneta Luca Zaia ordered the progressive evacuation of the Padua hospital which should take place within 5-6 days."

Samsung Electronics, the world's top smartp hone maker, said the floor where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the morning of Feb. 25. "The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the infected employee in self-quarant ine and taken steps to have them tested for possible infection," Samsung said in a news release. Samsung's factory in Gurni accounts for a small portion of its total smartphone production , and it makes high-end phones, mostly for the domestic market. Samsung produces most of its smaiiphones in Vietnam and India. Gumi is close to the city of Daegu , home to a church at the center of South Korea's largest coronavirns outbreak. South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 433. Samsung said production at its chip and display factories in other parts of South Korea would not be affected. Sent from Mail for Windows 10 From: Carte r Mecher

Others have been plying with and modify ing the notiona l conops for a healthcare system. I set up some simple rules: 1. Protect uninfected patients and staff from infectious patients and staff (using all the tools that we have includin g home isolation and home quarantine , cohorting/physical separation, PPE, telehealth, etc.) 2. Provide acute care for COVID pat ients (cont inuum of ER-inpatient care-intensive care) 3. Support mildly ill COVID patients in home isolation --telehealth 4. Support patients in voluntary home quarantine- -te lehea lth NIH-001475 

NIH-001476 5. Continue to address the usual mix of healthcare needs for patients (from outpatient care to acute care to mental health care to long term care) a. Outpatient clinics and providers focus on wellness to minimize ER visits/hospitalization to unburden the acute care system-leverage telehealth b. Continue to provide acute care and inpatient mental health care (continuum of ER-inpatient care-intensive care) for non￾COVID conditions c. Protect high-risk patients in residential/long term care (nursing homes, hospice, long term psychiatry, etc.) The notional conops divides the healthcare system into hot and safe areas. The hot area is only acute care: ER-acute inpatient care-ICU care. The safe areas include a separate acute care area (ER-acute inpatient care-ICU care), all the outpatient clinics/care, other inpatient care areas such as mental health, as well as long term/residential care (nursing home, hospice , long term psychiatry, etc.). Triage will not be easy (between hot and safe). Best I could come up with would be: ( 1) anyone already on home isolation or home quarantine (may need a medical record flag); (2) anyone with ILI ( could narrow that down with a negative rapid flu test); (3) anyone with a sick household member with suspected COVID. Could be very difficult for an unconscious/confused, or trauma patient etc., but would probably err on the side of hot and think of additional layered strategies to minimize patient risk within that area (private rooms, patient PPE?). Triage would need to err on the side of keeping the safe area safe. The mitigation measures are our best tools to reduce community transmission and reduce the probability of an infectious patient getting into a safe area. If we have a breach in a safe inpatient area, it pretty much converts that inpatient area into a hot area. That also means that we have the staff in that area exposed (because of limited availability of PPE, the staff in the safe area would not be PPE-PPE would have been directed to the staff in the hot area). Those staff would likely need to be placed on quarant ine. The effect is we now have a much larger hot area with even fewer staff. That would really be a mess. 

NIH-001477 You have the same problem in the outpatient areas. Have a sick patient slip through and come in contact with a number of the clinic staff (not in PPE), and we now need to quarantine all those staff. In contrast to a breach for the inpatient area, the outpatient area can still operate as a safe area (just minus those staff who would now be on quarantine). But do that a few times and pretty soon you have nobody left to fight. One way I thought about dealing with this scenario is to take the outpatient staff and split them in two. One group works the clinic (physically present) for the usual clinic hours for a 14 day stretch (1 incubation period) . Another group works from home (and practices social distancing, etc., really acting as if they are on home quarant ine) and leverages telehealth technology to care for patients and help with monitoring those patients in home isolation and home quarantine. After 14 days the groups switch. [All along we monitor employees daily (whether at work or at home) for symptoms or sick household membe rs] In the event of a breach, the groups immediately switch and the group that was working is placed on actual home quarantine (but still continues to work from home leveraging telehea lth). That way if a breach does happen, we have a fallback response (that we are constantly practicing) that allows us to sustain outpatient care. For the inpatient areas, I thought about the lone survivor model (holding back 1 Secretary and staff in the event that the government is decapitated). So think of a small group (would need to think thru what the composition of that team would look like for each area (acute care, inpatient mental health, long term care) that would at least provide the nucleus of the expertise necessary to reconstitute the service in the event of a major breach). This smaller group would vary in team members every 2 weeks and would rotate to work from home for 14 days stretches and practice social distancing ( acting as if they were on home quarantine). They could also assist via telehealth (inpatient consultation , etc., while out of the hospital). Is anyone thinking along these lines (really continu ity of operations for the healthcare system)?

Earlier in the day, a Navy sailor on the southern island of Jeju was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 in the first such case among service _personnel here. NIH-001482 

Follow ing the confirmat ion, the Navy has checked the temperature of all personne l at the base where the infec ted sailor served and quara ntined all those who had contacts with the pe rson, it said. "We have carried out disinfec tion work at the base and are devoting all our efforts to preventing the spread of the new virus," the Na:vy said in a release. An officer each from the Army and the Air Force were also confirmed to have the virus the same day. The military is now wo rking to ident ify personnel who have visited the southeastern city of Daeg u and the suffound ing Nort h Gyeong sang Province since Feb . 10, as these areas have rece ntly seen a surge in the number of infected people. More than 5,000 service persom1el are estimated to have visited the region during their vacation according to the military's preliminary inve stigatio n. On Thursday night the defense ministry said all personnel will be barred from vacationing, staying outside their bases and meeting v isitors starting Saturday. The decision was made at a meeting of top defense officials presided over by Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, during which he called for "extraordinary measures" to contain the s read of the virus. Amid growing fears over the disease , the govemment called off a planned ceremony to mark the 60th ann iversary of a pro-democracy movement in Daegu, which was designa ted a "special care zone" over the virus earlier in the day.

Korea reports 52 new virus cases, total now at 156 Welfare /Medicine 10:3 7 February 21, 2020 SEOUL, Feb. 21 (Yonhap)-- South Korea reported 52 new cases of tbe new coronavirus Friday, bringing the total numbe r of infections in the nation to 156, with the potentially fatal illness spreading fast across the country. The number of COVID-19 infections here has almost tripled in just three days, with most new infections traced to church services in the southeastern city of Daegu. Of the 52 new cases, 41 are in Dae gu, 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, and the neighboring North Gyeongsang Province. Another three were reported in Seoul, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement. Tour buses are parked at a logistics terminal in Daegu , 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, on Feb. 20, 2020. Thirty-eight new coronavirus cases were reported in the city on Feb. 21, 2010. (Yonhap) The spike of infections in Daegu and several cases in Seoul, where routes of infection s are not immediately traceable , have prompted health offic ials to declare that COVID-19 has begun spl!_ading locally. The KCDC said two new cases were reported in South Gyeongsang Prov ince . In a sign that the virus may broadly spread nationwide , six provinces, includ ing Gyeong gi, Jeju , Chungcheong and North Jolla, each repo rted one case. NIH-001484 

Of the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu , where the 31st patient, the country 's probab le "super spreader ," attended worship serv ices, the KCDC said. A 61-year-old South Korean woman, who tested positive for the virus earlier this week, attended worship services at the church on Feb . 9 and this past Sunday. KCDC Director Jung Eun-kyeong told reporters Thursday that the agency is uncertain whether the woman, known as the 31st patient , was a "super spreader" of the virus but asked 1,001 membe rs of the church to self-isolate to stem the spread of the virus. The government decided to designate Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo as "special management zones," following the spike in the number of infected people and the nation's first death from the virus.

As of Thursday, 634 passengers and crew members were diagnosed with the virus out of 3,063 tested. Slightly more than half have no symptoms at all, officials said, and many of the remainder have only mild fever or a cough. Among patients who tested positive for the virus, 28 were reported in serious condition Thursday. Doctors have said the vims can be particularly harmfu l in elderly patients, and one of the two fatal cases from the Diamond Princess, a Japanese man in his 80s, had pre-exist ing bronchial asthma and had been treated for angina. The other, a Japanese woman in her 80s without underlying illnesses, came down with a fever on Feb. 5, the same day passengers were told they would be quarantined in their cabins for two weeks, according to health ministry officials. The next day, she started suffering from dianhea and saw a doctor on board. She wasn't taken to a hospital until Feb. 12 when she started suffering shortness of breath. Her virus test came back posi tive the following day, and despite treatment with antivira l drugs norma lly used to treat HIV infection, she died Thursday. Asked about the woman's case, health ministry official Hiroshi Umeda said, "I believe it was handled promptly." He said the ship was a difficult environment for medica l staff but they worked day and night and tried to prioritize the most serious cases.

Daegu also urged residents to stay home as the city of 2.5 million people and surrounding areas struggled to contain an outbreak of the pneumonia-like disease . The Army garrison in Daegu also restricted access and announced that schools and nonessential business would be closed for a second day on Friday. NIH-001489 

NIH-001490 In an exception to policy, U.S. service members were authorized to wear face masks in uniform "regardless of air quality condit ions," according to the ga1Tison' s F acebook page. Fast-moving developments this week were a blow to South Korea's hope that the crisis was easing. Instead, dozens of new cases were confirmed in recent days, with the total number of infections soaring to 104 on Thursday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention U.S. Forces Korea said, "there remains zero confirmed cases ofUSFK personnel with COVID-19." The virus first appeared in December in Wuhan, China, and spread to nearly 30 countries. More than 2,000 people have died - most in mainland China. A South Korean man in his 60s died Wednesday at a hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo and posthumously tested positive for the virus, the KCDC said Thursday. It was South Korea's first death from the virus. USFK raised the risk level for the militar y communit y to moderate on Wednesday and banned all nonessential travel to Daegu due to an outbreak linked to a church near the Anny garrison in the city. On Thursday, USFK added that all travel by American troops to, from and around Daegu requires authorization from their leadership. The precaution was "highly encouraged" for all family members, civilians and contractors as well. "All off-insta llation travel for all USFK populations should be minimized to reduce potential contam ination," USFK announced on its website. U.S. Army Garrison Daegu, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, also said visitors not performing mission essential or official business would be denied access as it implemented health checks at the gates. Nonessential personnel were not required to go to work on Friday and most activities would be suspended , including the schools, it said. The garrison also recommended that members of the military commun ity avoid public places and transportat ion in the city, includin g 

stores, restaurants and other heavily congested areas until the situation is brought under control. Self-quarant ine measures were ordered for any American troops who had visited the affected New World Church, but garrison commander Col. Edward Ballanco said earlier Thursday that no Americans were known to have done so. He also urged Americans to avoid a local hospital where the woman believed to have been a carrier was treated. The garrison also lifted limits on wearing face masks for American troops in uniform, who normally are only allowed to wear them on days with extreme pollut ion.

The outbreak is starting to take off there with numbers of cases scattered across the country with no link to known cases. We are also seeing nosocomial transmission (a number of healthcare workers infected). There is also a large number of cases hospitalized in Japan related to the cruise ship, and now the release of large mLmbers of passengers from the cruise ship into the community. Yesterday they reported a total of 84 cases-caught up to NIH-001491 

Singapore. But unlike Singa pore , Japan has been slow to implement NPis. The other concern is that Japan's popu lation is disproportionately aged (it has the highest% age 65 of any country). In Japan, 27% of the population is :::_ 65; in the US, 15.6% of the population is~ 65. And Japan can also claim the largest city in the world (metro Toky o with 38 M people - pretty much the populat ion of California crammed into an area smaller than the size of Conn ecticut).

SANGEETA; Nathaniel Hupert Subject : RE: Red Dawn Breaking , COVID-19 Collaborative, Feb 16 start What has me worried is what happened on the cruise ship is a preview of what will happen when this virus makes its way to the US healthca re system (no t to mention institutionali zed high-risk population s in the US, like nursing homes). I'm not sure that folks understand what is ju st over the horizon. Remember the story about Mann Gulch? We are at the equiva lent of abou t 5:44. I anticipate that when we reach 5:45, there is go in g to be chaos and panic to get anything in place. I doubt that what we would NIH-001492 

NIH-001493 then hurriedly put in place will be any better than what they did on that cruise ship. As a consequence, would expect much the same results. I listened to the discussion yesterday. After listening to James and Michael describe the conditions on and around the cruise ship, I wondered whether anyone in healthcare leadership ( outside the expertise at our biocontainment facilities) is thinking about infection control practices for any staff entering areas of a hospital caring for COVID patients (like changing clothes before entering and perhaps wearing scrubs, not bringing personal items into the area like iphones, ipads, stethoscopes, white coats, purses, briefcases, etc .)? And instituting policies that require all patients to phone for clearance to enter prior to presenting at safe acute and non-acute areas including community based clinics? Are we confiden t of the infection control practices of acute care staff (that they know the basics of how to don and doff PPE and behavior while in PPE?) Would HCWs in outpatient clinics or long tem1 care facilities be any better prepared than the crew on board the cruise ship or the responders in Japan? I'm no expert in infection control and would defer to the expertise in this group. I was just a little smprised how little this seemed to be a concern for the healthcare leaders gathered yesterday. I think we are getting close to the point where we need to drop those things that are not critical and focus on the most imp01tant things. We are going to have a devil of time with lab confirmation - it is just too slow (they had a 2 day turnaround on the cruise ship) and we just don't have the capacity for the volume of tests we would anticipate. Charity has stressed this point again and again. That means we are going to have to fly blind early on. Perhaps the best we are going to be able to do in the near term if things begin to acce lerate is screen all suspect cases (pretty much anyone with ILi symptoms) with a quick flu test and assume anyone who tests negative is suspected COVID until proven otherwise; and treat everyone who tests positive with Tamiflu. It will prove problematic early on, but as the epidemic barrels along, COVID will displace everything (at that point we will just assume that anyone with a fever or ILi has COVID). The problem is in the beginning . It is going to be so hard to sort things out. Matt, James and others are pushing for more rapid screening- but we ju st aren't there yet. The consequence is that we will be placing patients with resp illness (that is not flu and presumed to be COVID) in areas with actual 

COVID patien ts. I hate to do that, but not sure how it could be avoided early on. But we wou ld only do that for those who are ill enough to be hospitalized. The large number of asymptomatic and mildly ill patients would be under home isolation (so no worries about mixing confinned and suspected patients). The downside is that we would have larger number of people is isolation and home quarantine than is really necessary (and the consequence of increased workplace absenteeism). And it is because home isolation and home quarantine are so important, healthcare systems (and not ju st public health) have to grab a hold of operationalizing those NPi s with both hands. A while back, I created some prescriptions (tongue in cheek), just to underscore that physicians do have a role in isolation and quarantine (it is not limited to public health). We might not have pharmaceutica ls available to treat COVID, but why can't we write prescriptions for non-pharmaceutica ls? I don't think healthcare leaders appreciate this point. Every COVID patient we admit or see in the ER will require us to follow up with household members to make sure they know to home quarantine (need to do the same anywhere in our system we find a patient who is infected). You could not imagine the pushback I have received when I proposed that we must have an active role-people seem to think that state and local public health is alone respons ible for this. I would think public health will be overwhelmed and taking charge of this is our best strategy to keep our safe areas safe. I would be interested to hear how other healthcare systems and public health leaders are thinking about this.

The latest update is the announcement of 2 deaths (both patients in their 80s). An 87- year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, died on the 20th. Both were Japane se (the 87-year-old man was hospitalized on Feb-11 and the 84- year-old women on Feb-12). So time to death from recognition of infection was 8-9 days. On Feb-12 , the total number of confirmed cases was 203. So estimated CFR back dating the denominator to Feb-12 is 1 %. Assuming a denominator of 621, the CFR is 0.3%. if death s are lagging by 8-10 days ( and con finned cases plateau), we should have a pretty good estimate of CFR for he entire group in another week or so. Will need to peel off the number of cases involving the crew member to get a better estimate of CFR in the elderly. These numbers are within the range we have been estimating. The 2,666 pass engers are similar in age (and likely in co-morbidities) to the population we see in a nursing home or residential care faci lity. The 1,045 crew are a proxy for a young healthy population. It will be important to look at the outcomes separately. One of the concerns is how a 'remake of this movie' could play out in similarly confined populations of elderly frail Americans. Here are the numbers of long term care facilities /programs in the US that care for the frail elderly. A large number of loc ations and a large numbe r of residents /p articipa nts. I know that healthcare leaders were engaged yesterday, is anyone engaging this sector (long term care)? The healthcare leaders seemed more concerned about critical supply shortages (akin to the IV fluid shortage). Listening to them, it felt like their concerns seemed almost divorced from the threat ofCOVID. NIH-001495

NIH-001501 Australian cruise passengers arrive to Darwin after Diamond Princess virus outbreak ordeal Feb 20 A rescue mission of Australian cruise ship passengers from Japan has officially landed in Darwin, but the ilight wasn't free from drama. Thousand s of people sharing toilets, pools and buffets - is this the petri dish of the sea? The Qantas coronavirus rescue flight, carrying about 180 citizens and permanent residents on board from Japan, has landed in Australia. Qantas flight 6032 touched down in Darwin at 8. 11am local time, after being slightly delayed from takeoff our of Haneda. The last-minu te drama hit the rescue mission when 10 Australians, who were set to leave the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess ship and head to the airport , were told they had tested positive to coronav irus and had to stay behind. About 180 citizens and permanent residents , who have spent the past fortnight on the quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan, had taken up the Federal Government' s offe r of a seat on the repatriation flight to Austra lia. They join another 36 Australians who contracted coronavirus on the Diamond Princess and are being treated in Japan. About 15 of their relatives declined the offer of repatriation to stay with them. The Australians on board will be screened for coronavirus five times before they are taken to a quarantine facility at Howard Qantas boss Alan Joyce praised the crew who took part in the repatriation flight as well as two previous Qantas chartered flights that broug ht Austra lians home from virus epicentre Wuhan . "It took literally thousands of hours to plan complex operations like these," Mr Joyce said at t press conference today. "The crew were all volunteers and they did us proud ." 

NIH-001502 Yesterday , Australians who were cleared to finally disembark the Diamond Princess were driven by bus to Haneda Airport for the chartered flight home. They first needed to pass a health check to receive an approval of disembarkation notice by Japanese quarantine officials. They were then screened several more times before they could board the Qantas 7 4 7. On the plane , they had no contact with Qantas crew, who remained upstairs for the flight. Food for passengers was already waiting for them at their seats when they boarded. If they passed the latest health check, they would have been given "approval of disembarkation" notices by Japanese quarantine officials, which grant them permission to enter Japan. From Yokohama Po1t, where the ship was docked, they boarded buses to Haneda Airport. Brisbane student Tehya Pfeffer, 18, who has been quarantined on the Diamond Prin cess with her grandmother Cathy, was among them. "At 10.30am (local time, 12.30pm AEDT) we will start to be screened and given luggage tags and wrist bands," Ms Pfeffer told news.com.au yesterday. "At 5pm we have to have our luggage put outside, and at 6pm we will disembark the ship and go through a makeshift customs. This is where we use our wrist bands. "And then we will take a bus to the airport and at around 12am Thursday we will fly to Darwin." On the evacuation flight, cabin crew would not be making direct contact with evacuees . Meals were already waiting for passengers at their seats when they boarded, and Qantas staff remained upstairs. All those retw·ning to Austra lia on the Qanta s flight will spend two weeks in quarant ine at the Howard Springs facility, in add ition to the two weeks in lockdown they've had on the ship.

There was a discussion about the shortages of PPE . There was also discussion re NP Is, but I'm not sure that most folks appreciate that the NPls that have been arrayed as part of the TLC strategy to reduce disease transmission in the community NIH-001503 

NIH-001504 can be leveraged to create safer compartments or spaces by shunting disease toward the home. By implementing these interventions, one could reduce the likelihood of disease in workplaces (by home isolation and home quarantine-- keeping sick employees at home and keeping employees who are well but potentially infected because someone is sick in their household, at home). Adding in other social distancing measures including social distancing at work, helps to reduce community transmission (adds additional protection to the workplace). The consequence is shunting disease to the home --120 M different compartrnents in the US, and making the workplace the safe place. That is potentially very important for critical infrastructure. The answer is not PPE for these employees. And why would we expect that employees in these sectors would have any better IPC with the use of PPE than we saw with staff on the Diamond Princess? Healthcare is a key critical infrastructure. It is different from the other sectors in that it will be attracting patients with COVID like a magnet. It is hard to imagine how one could makes healthcare a safe workplace. But it is only hard to imagine how one could do that unless you begin to look a little closer at the different components of the healthcare system and the roles each component might play during this pandemic . To illustrate this, I took a stab at developing a conops or roadmap to look at the various pieces of the healthcare system. The shunting of disease is really fractal. Just as we can look at shunting disease across a community into one compartment (the home) to make other compartments safer, we can do the same within our healthcare system￾shunt disease to the acute care area where COVID patients will be concentrated. What are the strategies to do that? This conops is notional. It is purposely designed for a severe outbreak with severe disease and assumes that the hea lthcare system must somehow continue to limp along and continue to care for the background disease we see during normal times (strokes, AMis, fractures and trauma, appendicitis, other serious infections, CHF, diabetic emergencies, psychotic episodes, preeclampsia, complicated deliveries, end stage renal disease and dialysis, etc.) as well as sustain outpatients with chronic conditions that require monitoring and care to keep them well and out of the ER and out of the hospital.

Hard to find data on the stah1s of those still hospitalized in Japan. James made a very important point yesterday. Altho ugh the passengers are elderly (2,666 passengers) , the crew membe rs are relatively young (1 ,045 crew members). James also expected the attack rates to be very high among the crew member s (they were housed together in a relatively small space aboa rd the ship, perfect conditions for explosive disease transmission). So this combined data on passengers (elderly) and crew (young and healthy) will be invaluable in terms of helping understand seve rity. I wou ld think that Japan also realizes how invaluable this data is. Japan will be in the best position to assess the impact on the crew, since they will know the results oflab screening and hospitalization of all + crew members (as well as the monitoring qua rantine of the rest of the crew over the next 14 days). But now that the passengers are being dispersed, it will be important for several nations to share the data on these passengers - it is really our best chance to understand severity (would need collabo ration of the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan).

NIH-001512 TOKYO Prime Ministe r Shinzo Abe on Tuesday advised peop le across the country not to go to work or schoo l if they develop cold-like symptoms, as the country grapples with the spread of a new coronavirus origina ting in China. Workplaces in the country, known for their long hours, need to encourage people to take days off without hesitation if they do not feel well , Abe said. "The first thing that I want the people of Japan to keep in mind is to take time off school or work and refra in from leaving the house if they develop cold-like symptoms such as fever," Abe told a meeting of a government task force on the viral outbreak. Te leworking is an "effective alternative" to help prevent the virus from spreading fmther, Abe said. He made the remarks as the governmen t is scrambling to contain the virus that originated in Wuhan, with more people with no obvious link to Ch ina gett ing infected in Japan. The global outbreak of the disease called COVID -19 has prompted some even t organizers in Japan to rethink their plans for hosting mass gather ings. The number of confirmed cases in Japan has topped 600, including over 500 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess , a quarantined cruise ship docked at Yokohama near Tokyo with more than 3,000 confined. The steady rise in infections in various pa1ts of Japan has raised public concern , prompting the health ministry to ask people who develop symptoms such as a temperature of 37.5 C or higher for at least four days to consult loca l health care centers and go to designated hospitals. The period is set shorte r for the elderly , those with underlying condi tions and pregnan t women. As Tokyo and othe r major cities in the country are notorious for packed rush-hour trains, commute rs have been encouraged by a government panel of medical experts to go to work earlier or later than usua l as the risk of infection is increased in crowds . 

On Tuesday, Fujitsu Ltd and Hitach i Ltd said they are expanding teleworking , though Japane se companies overall have been slow to introduce it.

NIH-001516 Hello all - Clearly , the most important thing of all is a reliable , real-time diagnostic test that can differentiate between flu and COVID-19. CDCs test kits were recalled because states said they were not working. Now they have to remanufacture the faulty reagent. How long will that take? If and when more kits are available , will they be available in sufficient quantity that all health care providers will have access? In all of this, I have not heard anyone talk about the Nanopore MinION technology that has been used for Ebola. What gives??? It is field deployable and can be run in-house. Hospital labs can run thousands of samples at once. It gives results of all viruses, bacteria, protozoa , fungi, in 2 hours. We all know this technology is quite promising. Why aren't we going gangbusters to validate this rapid technology and get it to all diagnosticians? If ever there was a time to invest in a diagnostic technology , this is it! Tracey

Cb><6J; KAUSHIK, SANGEETA Cb) (6); Na thani el Hu pert ========~ (b) ~(6) ~- Subject: RE: Red Dawn Breaking, COVID-1 9 Collaborative, Feb 16 start Carter, Just listened in to our state COV ID-19 response effort updat e. Georgia has no COVID-1 9 cases yet, and hence they remain in the conta inment period where they place medium-risk individuals on supervised monitoring of home quarantine, advise them to take temperature daily and report any respiratory symptoms (24/7). Educate them not to show up in ED, or any place without facilitation. To avoid potential disease spread, they are advised to remain at home. The next stage will be mitigation when a confirmed case is reported. That will initiate the pandemic planning and community-based NPI will be considered. This includes social distancing -- telework , teleclass , etc. I assume at cities where there are confirmed local COVID￾19 cases, the public health leaders have already begun the mitigation phase now and hence are practicing some degree of social distancing and rolling out telework, and various strategies to protect health in the population and to maintain business continuity already. Is that true or they are still wa iting to execute their operations? There are not many tests needed here in Georgia. But rapid robust and reliable testing kits (Tracey's reporting of current bottleneck) remain critical in all communities with positive cases. If we have such mean s, testing can also be conducted (sampli ng) on some flu-like cases at strategic selec ted cities also. NIH-001518

( asymptomatic or mild symptoms) this is the worry at the very start, and it remain s the most critical. Hence even 1 % of infection for us -- can balloon out of proportion and we can't handle . Shedd ing not only during infection period, bur also post-recove ry. It's a very long time line that we have to deal with. Then you have all the university siudents . Students travelled to China and came back to school, they asked hea lth service if they needed to quaran tine or take any action, theadvice -- no need. Those are missed opportunities. Again, seasonal influenza affects 8-10% Americans, 0.7% of those infected requir ed hospitalization , and morality is roughly 0.1 %. So it is easy to "calculate" all these numbers backwards ... So 20% ofCOVID￾19 infected may need hospitalization, mortality is 10-30 times higher than seasona l flu. How much can we tolerate before anyone would spring into action? Keep in mind, some begin to infect rapidly upon contracting the virus, the incubat ion is so short (and so long) and infectious too dming that period (with much being unknown). Ca1ter, I think you will expect hetero geneous approaches from different communit ies in the overall response strategy, since it depends on the socia l setting and the demographics and more importantly the local resources. We have to optimize for sure. NIH-001519

NIH-001521 My thinking is evolving in terms of healthcare system response. Initially I described how I would refocus the outpatient clinics away from COVID care and leverage the NPis of isolation and quarantine to help keep the workplace safe (for the clinic staff and other patients) rather than a strategy that employs PPE. I would only use the outpatient clinic staff to help with telephone /home care support of those patients under home isolation or home quarantine--to help with compliance /adherence to isolation and quarantine, monitoring their health, and optimizing the care of their other chronic medical conditions (to keep them out of the ER and the hospital). But as I thought more about this, it occurs to me that this can be generalized beyond outpatient clinics. I would think about dividing our healthcare system into two big pieces: ( 1) acute care (EDs, acute inpatient care, critical care); and (2) non-acute care including outpatient clinics (PC/Family Practice , pediatrics, OB/GYN, medical specialty, surgical specialty , dental, mental health, rehab, etc.), as well as other inpatient areas (inpatient mental health, substance abuse, nursing homes , hospice care, memory care, assisted living, etc.). Inpatient surgery (and I suppose labor and delivery) is part of acute care, but for this outbreak, it probably best belongs bundled with the other non-acute inpatient 

areas. I would anticipate that the tripwire for implementing NPis ( community transmission), will also be the trigger for healthcare systems to dial down or tum off elective admissions (primarily surgical) to free up acute care and ICU/monitored meds. The most effective way to protect these non￾acute areas is by shunting potential COVID patients away from these areas and either providing this type of care while the patients is hospitalized in acute care or thru telephone care/home care for patients with mild illness receiving care at home. And the most effective way to shunt these patients away from non-acute care areas is thru the implementation of early and aggressive NPis of isolation of the ill and home quarantine of household contacts ( and not fit testing the world and passing out PPE that we don't have) .

Speaking to reporters, WHO chiefTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent of patients would have severe diseases such as pneumonia. "Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death," he added. 

NIH-001531 Tedros also said there were "relative ly few cases" among children and more research was needed to understand why. The WHO chief also warned against "blanket measures" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a "tiny" proportion of the population. Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in centra l Hubei Province, the "attack rate" - a measure of the speed of spread of the virus - was four per 100,000. "This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected . Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people," be said. T edros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend "must be interpreted very cautiously".

The evacuees were not symptomatic. "These individuals were mov ed in the most expeditious and safe manner to a specialized containment area on the evacuat ion aircraft to isolate them in accordance with standar d protoco ls," the statemen t, pub lished Sunday , read. NIH-001544 

NIH-001545 The State Department was unaware the individuals had coronavirus when they were being removed from the ship; they had tested negative just a few days before, Robert Kadlec, the assistant secre tary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, said on a phone call with repmiers. "If those results had come back four hours earlier before we'd started to disembark the ship and before these people were evacuees within an evacuation system, then it would've been a different discussion." Dr. William Walters, director of operational medicine at the U.S. Department of State, said on the call. Kadlec said that individuals received multiple screenings when moving from ship to bus to plane and a more extensive medical assessment upon arrival. Two charter flights carrying the Diamond Princ ess passenger s landed at military bases in Ca lifornia and Texas overn ight, starting the clock on a 14-day quarantine period to ensure those passengers don't have coronavirus . In tota l, approximately 380 Americans were on board the Diamond Princ ess ship for the duration of the cruise and quarant ine at sea. 'Something went awry': Why did US break Diamond Princess coronavirus quaran tine? 

NIH-001546 One plane carrying American passengers touched down at Travis Air Force Base in northern California just before 11 :30 p.m. Sunday local time. A second flight arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas around 2½ hours later, early Monday. The California flight had 177 people on it, seven of whom tested positive for coronavirns, Walters said. An additional three people were isolated during the flight for fever. Upon arrival, 171 stayed in Travis while six traveled to Omaha. It's unclear which passengers were transferred there and whether initial tests were positive or whether they were at risk for the vrrus. The Texas flight had 151 people board and included the other seven who tested positive for coronavirus. Two additional passengers were isolated on account of fever. All passengers who tested positive for coronavirus then moved on to Omaha. The aircraft design allowed passengers to sit in isolation thanks to a plastic divider at the tail of the aircraft. 13 high-risk passengers awa it test results at Nebraska Medical Center 

NIH-001547 Officials from the University of Nebra ska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine confirmed that they are assessing 13 adults at their quarantine and bioconta inment facility in Omaha. "Late last night at about 2 or 3 a.m., we were asked to bring some individuals here who had either tested positive or had a high likelihood of testing positive because of symptoms they were exhibiting ," said Dr. Chris Kratochv il, the exec utive director at the University ofNebraska Medical Center 's Global Center for Health Security. Twelve of them are housed in the quarant ine center while one man was transferred to the hospital's biocontainment unit for testing and observation because of symptoms including cough, fever, shortness of breath, lightheadedness and an undisclosed chron ic condition that would make him particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 VITUS. "He is doing good and in stable condition at this time," reported Shelly Schwedhelm , Nebraska Medicine's executive director of emergency management and biopreparedness . She went on to note that "the folks in the quarantine center have all been tested, and we're waiting for those results." She added that the other 12 are isolated in "very nice rooms with WiFi , TV and a small refrigerator 

NIH-001548 - a lot of the amenities at hotels but with engineering contro ls" to prevent contaminated air from escapmg. Their test results, which are due back Monday afternoon, will determine whether the patients will be allowed to see their spouses or leave their rooms. Regardless of whether they test positive or negative, all of the new arrivals will spend at least 14 days in the facility , and any who test positive will likely stay longer, said Dr. Mike Wadman, the co￾medical director of the National Quarantine Unit. Kratochvil says it's possible that they may be asked to take more patients should more of the Diamond Princess passengers now in quarantine at the airbases test positive. Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the Nationa l Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told the USA TODAY editorial board and reporters Monday that the original idea to keep people safely quarantined on the ship wasn't unreasonable. But even with the quarantine process on the ship, virus transmissio n still occurred. "The quarantine process failed," Fauci said. "I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed. People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry in the process of the quarantining on that ship. I don't 

know what it was, but a lot of people got infected on that ship." USA TODAY reached out to Princess Cruises for clarification on how many Americans from the ship have the virus.

KAUSHIK, SANGEETA ; Nathan iel Hupert; (b)(6) Subject: RE: Red Dawn Break ing, COVID-19 Collaborat ive, Feb 16 start (b)(6); Trying to estimate severity by bringing a number of pieces together. The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship had a crew of l ,745 and 2,666 passengers (total pf3 ,7 11) Approximately 400 of the passengers are Americans (11 %). Several days ago (Feb-13) we attempted to estimate disease severity using the current data being reported by the media (number of confirmed cases and ICU cases) as well as data on the outbreak in Singapore (number of confinned cases, number hospitalized , and number in ICU) (see attached Word file). Given the additional information becoming available (including more specific information being reported by the media on the numbers of Americans infected), I was interested in an updated crude estimate of severity (and to see how well the early predictions of severity matched with what was being reported by the media on illness in the Americans. See NIH-001557 

NIH-001558 latest re the cruise ship outbreak below (two stories). We can glean from these stories that the number infected is now up to 454. And 14 positive passengers were included among the Americans who were evacuated to the US. Canada, South Korea, Italy and Hong Kong announced Sunday that they would also an-ange charter flights to evacuate their citizens. A few additional pieces of data. News reports yesterday stated that 73 of the 355 confirmed cases from the cruise ship were asymptomatic (20%). Also, yesterday the media quoted Dr. Fauci that the total number of Americans who were confirmed to have COVID yesterday and who remained at hospitals in Japan at 44. Assuming that this number does not include the 14 confirmed cases that were evacuated, suggests that the total number of Americans with confirmed COVID is 58. An earlier news report from Feb-12 re a couple from California, noted the husband was in the ICU in Japan (so at least 1 American in the ICU). [" ... remained in a hospital intensive care unit and has been able to communica te with his family, his wife said in a phone interview from the ship, where she remained in quarantine. " https://protect2 . fireeye. com/url ?k= 5b0 l 4cc3-075555bf -5b0 l 7dfc￾0cc4 7adc5fa2- 5be62cfl a816fc6d&u=https:/ /web. archive.org/web/202002 12093725 /https://www .ocregister.com/2020/ 02/11/sout hern-california -man-on￾cruise-sent-to-a-hosp ital-in-tokyo-

NIH-001559 with-a-high-fever-tested-for￾coronaviru s/ ] So, piecing all the data together: The ~400 Americans account for 11 % of the 3,711 passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess. The 5 8 confirmed cases among Americans account for 12% of the 454 total confirmed COVID cases Assuming that proportion of asymptomatic cases in Americans is similar to the proportion of asymptomatic cases for the entire ship (73/355 or 20%), we would estimate the number of Americans with asymptomatic infection at ~12. Symptomatics would be 46. If 2% of cases result in ICU admission (based on earlier estimates on Feb -12 where 4 ICU cases were reported with 203 total confirmed cases), we would expect ~9 ICU cases overall with 454 infected. Media repo1ts from today note 19 of the passengers are "seriously ill, with some of whom treated in intensive care units." (Would be helpful to quantify "some" - from the earlier data, we would estimate about half that number would require ICU care at some point). For the 54 Americans confirmed to have COVID, we would estimate 1 would require ICU care if 2% of cases required ICU care (we are already aware of at least 1 American who was receiving ICU care in Japan). 

NIH-001560 So estimates of seve 1ity looking only at the American passengers: ~400 total American passengers 58 confirmed to have COVID-19 12 Asymptomatic (20%) 46 Symptomatic (80%) ~55% of total cases mildly ill (hospitalized for isolation only) (31 cases) ~25% of total cases acute ly ill requiring inpatient care ( 15 cases) ~2% of total cases requiring ICU admission ( 1 cases) Exp ecte d mort ality for patie nts with pneu mon la admi tted to ICU (15- 50% ); assu mm g 

NIH-001561 2% of thos e who beco me infec ted with co YID -19 requ ire ICU care, thes e mor talit y rates equa te to a CFR of 0.3 %- 1.0 % Those estimates fit pretty well with the estimates from Feb-13 . To firm up these numbers it would be useful to have actual numbers from Japan on ICU admissions, number requiring mechanical ventilation, number in the hospital because they are acutely ill, and number in the hospital because of isolation only (mildly ill or asymptomatic). Also would be helpful to have more granular 

NIH-001562 information on the Americans (hospita l data in Japan including number acutely ill, number needing ICU admission , and number only in the hospital for isolation). Wou ld also be critical to gather/compile the same infonnation from Canada, South Korea, Italy, Hong Kong , and other nations as they also evacuate their citizens. The cruise ship is a circumscribed population where it is possible to get a handle on severity fairly early in an epidemic . The limitation though, is the population on board that ship is elderly (so need to be careful about genera lizing to the entire population). But it is the best data we have. The reason why this is so important is decisions re the implementation ofNPis depend upon severity (the more severe the more intense the NPis). The sooner we have a more accurate assessment of severity , the better for making plans for NPis.

As a result, 454 passengers and crew members of cruise ships have been infected, of which 19 are severely affected. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, a total of 99 new passengers, including 85 passengers and 14 crewmembers, were revealed on March 17 on the cruise ship "Diamond Princess" anchored in Yokohama Port. Among them, there are 43 Japanese. This means that a total of 1723 passengers and crew members were inspected on the cruise ship, and a total of 454 infection s were confirmed. According to the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare, 19 of the confim1ed individuals are seriously ill, some of whom are being treated in intensive care units. According to the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare, the Minist1y of Health , Labor and Welfare said that infections were confirmed one after another on 

NIH-001564 cruise ships. Need to be analyzed quickly." The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has a policy to conduct a virus test on all passengers and crew members remain ing on board, and those who have a negative result will be asked to leave the ship after the 19th. Story #2 Fourteen people who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and flown back to the United States on charter flights tested positive fornovel coronavirus , according to a joint statement from the US Departments of State and Health and Human Services. The passengers are among the more than 300 people removed from the ship, which is docked off the Japanese port city of Yokohama , Sunday night and flown to milita1y bases in the United States. US officials were notified that they had tested positive for coronavirus during the evacuation process, after passengers had disembarked the ship, the agencies said in the joint statement Monday . The passenge rs had been tested two to three days before the 

NIH-001565 evacuation flights, the statement said. "After consultation with HHS officials, including experts from the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the State Department made the decision to allow the 14 individuals, who were in isolation, separated from other passengers, and continued to be asymptomat ic, to remain on the aircraft to complete the evacuation process," the agencies said. One charter flight carrying evacuated Americans arrived at Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield, Californ ia, around 11 :28 p.m. loca l time Sunday. A second anived at Joint Base San Antonio￾Lackland in San Antonio, Texas at 3:56 a.m. local time Monday. The passengers who tested positive were isolated from the other passengers during the flights, the statement said. And all passengers are being "closely monitored" throughout the flight. "Any who become symptomatic will be moved to the specialized conta inment area, where they will be treated," the statement said. After the flights land, any passengers that developed symptoms on the flights and those who had already tested positive will be transported to "an appropr iate location for continued isolation and care ." 

NIH-001566 The remaining passengers will remain under quarant ine for 14 days. Passengers arriving to Travis Air Force Base will be housed in the same facility as evacuees who arrived from Wuhan earlier this month, a spokesperson for the base told CNN. New evacuees will be kept in a separate area of the Westwind Inn on the base, the spokesperson said. Before the announcement about the infected flight passengers, some Americans aboard the Diamond Princess said they didn't want to take a chance being evacuated for fear they would be subject to possible infection. Sacramento resident Matthew Smith told CNN affiliate KOVR that he would rather deal with issues in Japan than be evacuated and quarantined in the United States. "We decided we would j ust face whatever consequences here rather than exposing ourselves to that situation ," Smith told the affi liate. "It kind of didn't make any sense if the us was fearful that these were infected people which is why they're going to quarantine them for another 2 weeks to have thrown them all together" Smith's wife Katherine Codekas was met with some surprise when she told authoriti es that she and her husband weren't going to go with the other American evacuees, KOVR reported. 

"They came back around again and I said no we're not going and they very sincerely wished us luck but there was a little look of surprise on their face ," Codekas explained to the affiliate. "You know, it's not like we're the last helicopter off the roof top in Ho Chi Mihn City," she told KOVR. "We're on a boat and we're watching peop le go away and people just make different choices about how they want to confront the virus."

KAUSHIK, SANGEETA ; Nathan iel Hupert Subject: RE: Red Dawn Breaking , COVI D-19 Collaborative , Feb 16 start (b)(6); This is the original graph of Bob Gla ss' data. He modeled the various interventions alone or in combination. Along one axis are the social distancing measures from doin g nothing, to ju st closing schools but allowing kids to mix in the community , to social distancing of kids in th e community but keeping schools open, to only social distancing of adults in the community , to closing schools and adults socia l distancing, to kid s and adults socia l distancing in the community, to closing schools and socia l distancing of kids in the community, to a combo of all 3. Along the other axis are other interventions including doing nothing, to quarantine (Q) , treatm ent of the ill wit h antivirals (T), proph ylaxis of contacts (P), and variou s combinations. We observed what we called a " cliff effect" or phase transition or a discontinuity once you closed scho ols and implemented social distanc ing among kids. The effect was non -linear and drama tic. As a consequence we began a deep dive to better understand the sch ool environme nt (includi ng the NIH-001570 

NIH-001571 transportation system half the school age kids use each day) and school age kids. An unsung hero in all this was Lisa Koonin (who was at CDC at the time). If Richard birthed TLC, Lisa kept the baby alive in the neonata l ICU. We still have much to learn about this virus. Thus far, it seems to be sparing kids (just like SARS). We have been monitoring the reports from China as well as the detailed data we can see from Hong Kong , Singapore , and Japan - the numbers of kids remain very low and disease appears to be mild. Nonet heless, TLC (and the NPis) is focused on reducing disease transmission ( effective ly decreasing Ro )- the interventions are rea lly agnostic to severity. It is why CDC had to scale the implementation of TLC (later called CMG) to severity. Despite the abse nce of severe disease in kids, we really are still in the dark in tem1s of the amount of asympto matic disease or mild sub￾clinical disease in kid s becau se we just haven 't been able to look. I never forgot this gra ph of the data from Bob Glass and the inflection point that was observed when the combo of closing schools and social distancing of kids was implemented in his model. Although closing schools is complicated by its 2nd and 3rd order impacts, it is actua lly a pretty clean intervent ion in tenns 

of actually pulling the trigger (much cleaner than the other component s ofTLC) . If this outbreak proves to be as severe as our initial estimates, we should think long and hard before dismissing the early implementation of th is strategy ( closing schools and social distancing of kids).

Th is email group has grovvn since we began (not quite epidemic-level growth, but getting there) . Looking ahead, I anticipate we might encoun ter pushback over the implemen tation ofN Pls and would exp ect similar concerns/arguments as were raised back in 2006 when this strategy first emerged. It was one of the reasons I shared the updated data on US household s from American Community Survey, data on USDA programs for nutrit ional support (inc luding schoo l meal program s), data on schoo ls and enro llment, and even data on juvenile crime. The data that was gathered back in 2006 on socia l density in various environments NIH-001573 

NIH-001574 (homes, offices/workplaces, schools, daycare , etc., is unchanged) . For additional background and context, we attached are 3 papers on NPis and TLC for those who are interested. Richard Hatchett deserves full credit for birthing the idea of TLC (it was actually developed in response to the threat of HSN 1 and later adopted for pandemic influenza response). Duane, perhaps you can store these documents on MAX for safe keeping and access? The first paper is an historical review of the 1918 pandemic (the comparison of Philadelphia and St. Louis is emblematic of the lesson from 1918 that timing matters when deploying NPls￾need to be early) . The second paper is modeling work that was done to evaluate these strategies. At the time, modelers were focused on how best to contain an outbreak overseas (really focusing on using antivirals primarily for treatment and prophylaxis). They focused their models to evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies and quantities of antiviral medications required to quench an emerging outbreak . There were 3 groups who were doing this work back then. They each present their data in that paper. A few things to note. In all the model runs, they did not model perfection or 100% adherence (actually far from it). You will see scenarios from 30/60 (meaning 30% compliance and 60% ascertainment) on up to 90/80 ). (See figures 1) Even leaky implementation can reduce overall 

NIH-001575 attack rates. The modelers also looked at timing of implementation (see figure 3). At the time there was a great deal of skepticism-was hard for people to believe this was possible . Or even if TLC could be effective, was implementation practical given the challenges trying to implement and the 2nd and 3rd order consequences ( especially of closing schools). But the modeling data combined with the histolical data was the tipping point. Marty Cetron from CDC and Howard Markel from U of Michigan, published a more extensive historical review of the 1918 pandemic showing much the same. Since then, a group within CDC continued to work on this ( collecting additional data from the 2009 pandemic and elsewhere). They published an update of CMG in MMWR in 2017. h ttps:/ /protect2 .fireeye . com/url ?k= 3985fc87 -65d l e5fb-3985cdb8 - 0cc4 7 adc5 fa2- bb4a28 993 b5aa9e0&u=https:/ /ww w .cdc.gov/media/dpk/cdc-24- 7 /preventing-pandemic - influenza /community -mitigation - guidelines-for-preven ting￾pandemic-flu.html The third paper, is a more recent paper ( from 201 7) that Richard shared with me. The paper is a little dense, but I found this paper useful because it provides a vocabulary for strategies that we have raised (Symptom Monitoling vs 

NIH-001576 Quarantine of potentially infected but symptom-free contacts during an epidemic). This paper identifi es those conditions where SM or Q is preferred. Figure 1 is useful for und erstanding the challenges given the picture that seems to be emerging with this virus. This outbreak seems closer to pandemic flu than SARS in terms of transm ission dynamics ( and hence the NPis we would need to employ). Lastly, another person, Bob Glass at Los Alamos, also did work on this separately from the MIDAS group. He actually began this work as pa1t of a science fair project for his daughter (using social contacts of his daughter and her classmat es at school to model disease transmission). He knew someone at VA who forwarded his work to us ( chain of transmission). Early on ( even before the MIDAS group modeled TLC), we had a "Eureka" moment when we graphed his data in Excel (I can share that single graph to anyone interested). Bob Glass was also interested in trying to determine when you could let up on the NPis during a pandemic. Here is a story about Bob Glass and that work published in Fast Company https: //protect2.fueeye. com/url ?k= 3862f880 -6436e l fc-3862c9 bf￾0cc4 7adc5fa2- 9ce5afJ 1 e3c2cd6 4&u=https :/ /ww w .fastcompany .corn/3058542 /the￾scientists-who-simulate-the-end￾of-the-world I will see if I can find his work on when to reopen schools. Decisions in terms of 

letting up on NPis could be critical down the line.

Separate current ED/ICU patients from COVID-19 is a must. NIH-001580 

NIH-001581 2. Migrating current ED/ICU (non-COVID) patients to other care sites is great idea . 3. Caring for COVID-19 patients: leveraging ED/I CU personnel for high comp liance and usage of limited resources (PPE everything that goes with it) is very critical. Strategic usage and minimizing non-medical staff is necessary --- either these operators are well-trained and protected, or they cannot be there. 4. Concentrating care within ED/ICU for COVID-19 ensures rap id learning and sharing of knowledge among workers as they take care of these patients. Clearly from the standpoint of data collection and clinical symptoms record ing and organization, it is more feasible and allow for immediate analysis and feedback. 5. Strategic prioritization of limited resources is extremely impo1tant. We must do it now, because the supp ly chain is already being affected and it can go worse. 6. Primaiy care and call centers are good. If you want to do strategic testing , this is also a good place to involve . 

7. So few children are reported among the confirmed positive cases. They may be good spreaders (not necessarily have to be super) and the more vulnerable people would be ones show up with symptomatic disease characteristics (or no/mild symptoms).

I have been concerned about some of the preparedness efforts of healthcare systems NIH-001582 (b)(6) 

NIH-001583 as they are ramping up their capab ilities to care for patients with COVID-19 presenting anywhere in their system. Staff working in ERs and ICUs are pretty familiar with the care of these types of patients and the use of appropriate PPE (standard contact and airborne precautions including eye protection). The staff at the hospitals undergo fit testing for respirators, etc. Staff in outpatient clinics ( especially remote community based outpatient clinics) don't typically undergo fit testing for respirators. So ERs and ICUs have muscle memory for isolating patients and prov iding care to patients with infectious respiratory disease. Community based outpatient clinics do not. As part of the preparedness efforts, there has been interest in fit testing outpatient clinic staff and supp lying these clinics with PPE and establishing procedures for 

NIH-001584 evaluating COVID-19 patients in the commun ity based clinics. Given the projected shortages of PPE, that just doesn't seem like the most prudent approach. Rather than expand the care of potential COVID-19 patients to community based outpatient clinics, I would focus on hospital care--ERs and inpatient areas (especially ICUs). I would not pursue fit testing for staff working in outlying clinics. As a strategy, I suggested dividing COVID patients into two categories-(1 ) those with illness that is mild enough to be cared for at home ( self care or care by other family members); or (2) those who are sick enough to be seen in the ER for possible hospitalization. I would refocus the efforts of outlying clinics away from COVID and toward keeping non-COVID patients with the usual mix of acute and chronic illnesses we see from hypertension to CHF to diabetes, 

NIH-001585 etc., out of the ER and out of the hospital. That is what they can do to help unburden ERs and hospitals for the surge in COVID patients in ERs and hospitals. I would leverage telephone care as much as possible to handle patients with mild disease seeking care related to COVID (and quickly develop algorithms to detennine who has mild disease and can be managed by telephone at home and who needs to evaluated in the ER). Think of it like the program Lisa developed for pandemic influenza (Nurse On Call) on steroids, minus the antivira l piece. Could we repurpose and leverage that program for COVID? Such a strategy would help to conserve om PPE supply (avoid the expansion of fit testing and the redirection of already limited supplies of PPE to outlying clinics) and not ask outlying clinics to do something they don't typically do (that usually doesn't out turn out very well). If 

NIH-001586 the outlying clinics focused on what they normally do (caring for patients with chronic diseases), they could help the ER and hospitals cope with the demands of COVID. I would think about Urgent Care centers in the same way- to help to decompress ERs. I also think that we need to start thinking about strategies to conserve PPE for hospitals. I'm concerned about the projected burn rates and the supply chains for PPE. Click on Amazon and check out the prices now. Or click on WalMart (can't pick up any masks from WalMart now). I saw one supplier selling 200 surgica l masks on WalMaii's site for only $459.99. Such a deal. As a conservation strategy, we might think about limiting the amount of staff interacting with infected patients and cohorting patients ( even thinking of strategies to minimize need for 

NIH-001587 housekeeping or food service or lab services from entering areas with COVID patients- -think Ebola-like strategies (not out of concern of disease transmission but simply to limit number of staff to conserve PPE). Could do something similar with ERs ( akin to what pediatricians do to separate sick call patients from other appointments). I have recommend prioritizing PPE for EDs and ICUs as well as specific inpatient areas where we would likely initially cohort patients, not pursuing fit testing of outpatient clinic staff, and shifting patients with mild COVID disease to telephone care and away from outpatient clinics. I know several of you are part of large healthcare systems. Am curious how others are approaching this challenge. I am also resending the questions I posed 

for handling sick ER/hospital staff or staff members with a confinned case of COVID in their hou seho ld.

NIH-001767 Update on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan We commend the extraordinary efforts by the Government of Japan to institute quarantine measures onboard the Diamond Princess. While the quarantine potentially conferred a significant public health benefit in slowing transmission, CDC's assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. CDC believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk. Therefore, to protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the United States for at least 14 days after they had left the Diamond Princess. Currently , there are more than 100 U.S. citizens still onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship or in hospitals in Japan. These citizens have been placed under the restrictions, as have the ship's other passenge rs and crew. After disembarkation from the Diamond Princess, these passengers and crew will be required to wait 14 days without having symptoms or a positive coronavirus test result before they are permitted to board flights to the United States. If an individual from this cruise arrives in the United States before the 14-day period ends, they will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine until they have completed the 14-day period with no symptoms or positive coronavirus test results. Because of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess. CDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of all Americans. We continue to believe that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the general public in the United States is currently low. The U.S. Government is taking these measures to protect the Diamond Princess passengers and crew, their loved ones, the traveling public, and communities within the Un ited States. ### U.S. Department of Hea lth and Human Services CDC works 2417 protecting America's health, safety and security. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are curable or preventable , chronic or acute, or from human activity or deliberate attack, CDC responds to America's most pressing health threats.

(OS/ASPA) CbH6J>; McKeogh, Katherine {OS/ASPA) (b)(6) Subject: WaPo - fact check on coronavirus story Hey Caitlin and Katie, Happy Friday! I'm working on a story about the coronavirus response, aim ing to publish tomorrow. The story is about how President Trump has praised China and President Xi, but that has made some of his advisors uncomfortable given the lack of transparency from China and the inability to get CDC scientists in to the country. We also have some details about the response and the task force , and some disagreements that have arisen. I've listed the points we have in the story that pertain to HHS- would you be able to take a look, let me know if there are any issues and potentially provide a comment? I included some quotes from Sec. Azar's interviews on Friday with CNN and CNBC but also happy to include a quote from the agency. NIH-001859 

I realize I'm sending this at the end of the day, so would it be possible for you to get back to me by 1 pm tomorrow? Let me know what works on your end. Thanks so much. • President Trump has lavished praise on China and its ruler, Xi Jin ping, for its handling of the growing coronavirus outbreak - a posture some in his administration are growing increasingly uncomfortable with as his advisors remain concerned about China's transparency and handling of the epidemic . • Trump's praise towards Xi has irked some advisors, who say those comments and others about how the virus wil l likely behave reflect how the president is being briefed, underscoring tensions within the admin istration over its handling of the outbreak and the message it should be sending to the American public. • Worries about the market and tenuous negotiations with China over a trade deal have played a large role in influencing Trump 's friendly posture . • Trump has told advisors he does not want the administration to do or say anything that would further spook the markets, but remains worried that any large-scale outbreak in the U.S. could hurt his reelection bid. • For weeks, the administration's messaging was that the th reat to the American public remained low and the virus was not spreading within communities. But some advisors pushed for a more balanced message because they expect there to eventually be some commun ity spread as the outbreak grows, and the administration has since adjusted its message to reflect that. • In an effort to keep Trump calm and restrained, Azar has been briefing the president that "everything is under control, totally under control," which has kept Trump from doing or saying anyth ing drastic. • HHS officials have also told Trump that the number of infections could go down in the spring when it gets warmer, which is mainly an educated guess. • Some officials have complained that Trump's comments emanate from his briefings with Azar, who they say has sought to control the response. He has told other doctors , including Anthony Fauci, not to get too far into the details of the virus and outbreak with Trump . Instead, Azar has instructed doctors to let him handle it. • Azar has also wanted to be the one to announce major updates about the administ ration's response to the virus . On Thursday, he briefed the Senate Finance Committee that the CDC would use public health labs in five cities that normally test for infl uenza to also test for coronavirus, taking state health officials by surprise. • Some officials said the response has become smoother and better coordinated in recent weeks.

Medical workers in protective suits gather Friday at a temporary hospital at Tazihu Gymnasium in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province. (AP) By Anna Fifield, Min Joo Kim and Simon Denyer Feb. 22, 2020 at 10:17 a.m. EST There are new indications that the incubation period for the virus could be longer than the currently believed 14 days, with patients testing positive after much longer quarantine periods. This development came as infections rose in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy and the head of the World Health Organization warned that the w indow for stopping the epidemic was narrowing . Here's wh at we know: • Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been advised that the situat ion in Wuhan "remains grim and com pie><." • South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, with the number of cases in South Korea doubling in a day. A fifth person died in Iran from the virus, while Italy now has 50 confirmed cases, making it the largest hot spot in Europe. • China reported only 397 new cases Saturday, as the rate of increase continued to decline, but an addit ional 109 people have died. There continues to be a great deal of skepticism about China's numbers as t he criteria for diagnosing coronavirus keep changing. • A team of international epidemic experts had Wuhan added to their itinerary in China, following questions about why they wouldn't go to the center of the coronavirus outbreak tha t has caused more than 2,000 deaths in the country . • Scientists in China said they had isolated coronavirus strains in urine, raising the possibility that it might be transmissible that way, as well as through fecal matter and respiratory droplets . NIH-001622 

NIH-001623 BEIJING - Scientists are studying reports that the incubatio n period for coronavirus could be longer than the current ly believed 14 days, potentially casting doubt on current quarant ine crite ria for contain ing the virus amid an increasingly urgent effort to stop the epidemic from spreading in northeast Asia and across the world. South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, wh ile in China, an addit ional 109 people died and a fifth person died from the virus in Iran. Italian authorities on Saturday said the country was seeing a sudden rise in coronav irus cases, with roughly 50 confirmed in the past two days - an outb reak that represents the largest yet across Europe. Meanwhi le, scientists in China reported indications that the virus might be transmissib le through urine. A team of experts from the World Health Organization was due to arrive Saturday in Wuhan, the epicente r of the coronavirus outbreak. WHO director-gene ral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday stressed the urgency of conta ining the spread of the coronavirus, after cases were reported earlier in Iran and Lebanon. "Although the window of opportun ity is narrowing to conta in the outbreak , we still have a chance to contain it," he told reporters in Geneva. "If we don't, if we squander the opportunity, then there will be a serious problem on our hands." Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has not visited Wuhan since the outbreak began, was briefed t hat the situation in the city and in surround ing Hubei prov ince "rema ins grim and complex," according to a report by the official Xinhua News Agency published Saturday. "The nationw ide inflect ion point of the epidemic has not yet arrived," the report said after a meeting of Communist Party leaders. China's National Health Commission reported Saturday that 397 new cases of coronav irus had been diagnosed Friday, tak ing the tota l to more than 76,000. The rate of infection outside Hubei appears to have slowed markedly, althoug h there has been a great deal of conf usion about the statistics th is week as officials have repeatedly changed the crite ria for confirming cases. Among the new cases discovered Friday were a 70-year-old man in Hubei who was confirmed as infected after 27 days in isolation, while a man in Jiangxi province tested posit ive after 14 days of entralized quarantine and five days of isolation at home. On Thursday, autho rities reported that a man in Hubei had tested positive for coronav irus after what appeared to be a 38-day incubation period with no symptoms. Coronavirus cases in South Korea skyrocket; cases triple in Japan In Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Saturday that 229 addit ional cases of the coronav irus had been detected, taking the tota l to 433, more than doubling in the space of a day. This makes it the worst -affected count ry outs ide China. "Apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, [South] Korea now has the most cases outs ide China, and we're work ing closely with the government to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to th is increase," Tedros said. The majority of the new cases have been traced to existing clusters at a church in southern city of Daegu and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, according to the KCDC. The South Korean government has designated Daegu and surrounding Nort h Gyeongsang province as "special care zones" where conta inment efforts and support will be concentrated. More than half of South Korea' s cases are connected to Daegu branch of the Shincheonj i Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony . Since members of the church attended a fune ral at nearby Cheongdo Daenam hospital, 111 coronavirus cases have been reported the re, including two patients w ho died from the virus. 

NIH-001624 The mass infection at the hospital is centered on its locked psychiatric ward, where a confined environment could have aggravated transmissions, said Jung Eun-Kyeong, director of the KCDC. A man in his 40s was found dead at his home in city of Gyeongju, east of Daegu, after becoming infected with the virus. He is the third person to die from the virus in South Korea. Trump was not told coronavirus-infected Americans would be fl ow n home from cruise ship In Japan, the number of coronavirus cases rose to 121 on Saturday, more t han tripling in a week. That number excludes the 634 people on board the Diamond Princess who contracted the virus. One of the latest cases was a teacher in her 60s at a public junior high school east of Tokyo, who complained of nausea whi le working. The mayor of Chiba city said the school will be closed until Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK reported. The teacher had not traveled abroad in the past two weeks and has no record of having been in contact with a known infected person, underl ining the fact that the virus is now spreading almost invisibly throughout the country, experts say. Quarantines in effect in parts of Italy amid sudden spike in cases As numbers suddenly rose in Italy, the government has scrambled to contain the new outbreak, asking some 50,000 people to stay indoors and suspending all public events - including religious ceremonies and school - in 10 small towns to the south of Milan. Until a few days ago, Italy had seen only three confirmed infections, including a pair of Chinese tourists. "There is quite an evident contagion, a very strong one," said Giulio Gallera, health chief of the northern Lombardy region, which has seen the majority of the cases. Italian officials on Friday attributed the country's first death to the coronavirus, and on Saturday said that a 77-year-old woman had also tested positive for the virus after being found dead in her home. But Italian authorities said the woman suffered from other health conditions, and were unsure if it was the virus that had killed her. As of Saturday afternoon, there were 39 confirmed cases in the prosperous Lombardy region, which includes the country's financial hub, Milan . There were another 12 cases in the neighboring northern region of Veneto. The regional president of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said it is becoming harder to figure out how the virus is jumping from one place to the next. "It goes to show you that having other cases of contagion is absolutely possible," Zaia said. According to Italian media reports , one of the first peop le to come down with the virus was a 38-year￾old who'd had dinner with somebody who had just come back from China. But some three wee ks passed between that dinner and the time the man came down with a fever. In between, he ran a half￾marathon, played soccer and traveled to several towns, according to La Repubblica, a major Italian daily . Iran, meanwhile, announced its fifth death from t he virus, raising the country's overall total confirmed cases to twenty eight . Efforts to clear the Diamond Princess cruise ship continue Meanwhile, tests are continuing on the crew members on board the Diamond Princess. At least 74 crew members have so far been found to have the virus. All of the passengers have now been tested and almost all have left the ship, either to go home if they tested negative, to local hospitals or government facilities if they have the virus, or back to their home countries. Some passengers were asked to stay on board to serve an additional quarantine if their cabin mate contracted the virus, but this group is also disembarking Saturday to serve out the rest of their quarantine in a government facility, local media reported . In China's 'war' on coronavirus. hospita ls turn away ot her patients - with dire result s 

NIH-001625 More than 200 port calls in Japan by international cruise ships have been canceled since the beginning of February due to the coronavirus outbreak, a Kyodo News survey showed Saturday, with the lost revenue from passengers coming ashore dealing another blow to Japan's weak economy . Controversy continues to simmer about the infection control procedures on board the ship, after a doctor complained on Tuesday about "chaotic" and scary conditions on board . Six people working on the boat or with the passengers, including four government officials, a medic and an ambulance driver, have contracted the virus. Media reports questioned why about 90 government officials who worked on the ship have returned to work without being tested for the coronavirus . Asked about this, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government is "trying to confirm what operations staff were involved in specifically." Amer ican woman in Malays ia declared free of coronavirus The 83-year-old woman who tested positive for the coronavirus when she arrived at Kuala Lumpur airport after disembarking in Cambodia from the MS Westerdam cruise ship has recovered, Malaysia health authorities said Saturday. The woman "is showing good improvement and signs of recovery, however, she is still being monitored and managed in hospital for a slight cough," Malaysia's director general of health, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said in a st atement. The woman repeatedly tested negative while on board the ship and when she disembarked in Sihanoukville, then twice tested positive wh ile transiting in Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 15. That set off a global scramble to track the hundreds of other passengers who had also disembarked then boarded planes bound for home. The woman was taken to a hospital and given antiviral treatment and supplementary oxygen, and she showed improvement after 72 hours of treatment initiation, Abdullah said. Two more tests, conducted 24 hours apart, both came back negative for coronavirus. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cast doubt on whether the woman was ever infected, saying she "never had coronavirus to our knowledge ." "I have confirmed that all the passengers were tested, and they have come back negative for coronavirus, including the person who initially tested positive ," USA Today quot ed CDC spokesperson Richard Quartarone as saying. The woman " may have had a respiratory illness, but if she did, it was not covid-19," he said, using the official name for the virus. Cambodia's Ministry of Health had previously cleared the 747 crew members who were still on board the Westerdam and the 781 passengers who were still in the country of coronavirus infection . Chinese scientists isolate coronavirus strains in urine as WHO prepares visit Separately, scientists in China are continuing to study how the virus is transmitted . A research team led by renowned Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan had isolated live coronav irus strains in urine samples from infected patients, Zhao Jincun, a respiratory expert at the State Key Laboratory, told reporters in Guangdong on Saturday. The team of scientists had previously said the virus, in addition to being carried in respiratory drop lets, appeared to be transmissible through fecal matter, underscoring the need to practice good hand washing as a preventive measure. Zhao did not directly say that the virus could be transmitted through urine, simply noting that the strains had been isolated and that this had implications for public health control. They are cont inuing to work on isolating the virus and on a cure, the Guangzhou Daily reported. But he said people should pay more attention to personal and family hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus and recommended frequently washing hands, closing the toilet lid before flushing and making sure bathroom drains are not blocked. 

NIH-001626 WHO experts have also been on an investigative mission in China this week, holding meetings in Beijing and traveling to the prov inces of Sichuan and Guangdong. But they had not been scheduled to travel to Wuhan , where the outbreak began at a live animal market and which remains under strict lockdown in an effort to contain the virus. This had led to speculation that the Chinese government, which has come under fire for its slow response to the outbreak and where medical workers are stretched to the limit, did not want the experts to visit. But the WHO said late Friday that the experts would be travel ing to the center of the outbreak on Saturday, although they gave no further information about their itinerary . Kim reported from Seoul and Denyer from Tokyo. Lyric Li in Beijing, Akiko Kashiwagi in Tokyo and Chico Harlan and Stefano Pitrelli in Rome contributed reporting.

Visby Medical has developed a rap id (~25 min sample-to-answer) palm-sized, 40 cycle PCR (or RT-PCR) single-use device that does not requ ire an instrument; it is used once, and then discarded or recycled . (b)(4) device is stable at room temperature for up to two years and thus it could be deployed widely. NIH-001874 

NIH-001875 We are seriously considering using this platform to develop a rapid test to detect COVID-19. Proof of principles that have been achieved toward that end are our demonstration that the device can use two-step RT-PCR to detect influenza A and Bin NP swab samples. The main features of the device are described in the brief accompanying PDF. I write now because we are unsure, if we were to produce a COVID-19 device, how it would be deployed, by whom it would be used and who might be willing to purchase it. I would be very grateful if you might be able to speak briefly with me and my colleagues about these open questions. I am convinced this device can meet a major unmet need in clinical care and disease control for this epidemic and we, as a group, want to make a difference. Your advice would be invaluable as we weigh the risks and benefits of pivoting the company to this application. With all best wishes; I hope all is well with you and your family. gary Gary Schoolnik, M.D. Professor of Medicine Stanford Medical School Attending Physician (Internal Medicine , Infectious Diseases) Stanford University Hospital Chief Medical officer Visby Medical

A reporter from the Italian health website Pazienti.it reached out to you directly with questions about coronavirus vaccine development. I have drafted proposed responses for your review attached and pasted below. I will send the final responses to the reporter attributed to you. Coronavirus vaccine: when will it be available? What are the diffi culties? The National Institutes of Health is on track to test an experimental messenger RNA (rnRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in recip ients . It is importa nt to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will likely not be widely available for at least a year. NIH-001890 

Could the Coronavirus mutate, if a vaccine cannot be found in time? We are learning more about the novel coronavirus every day. At this tim e, we are not awar e of any mutations that might affect vaccine development . Based on our experience with ot her coronav iruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is unlikely - but not impossible - that the novel coronav irus will mutate in a way that would have an impact on the development of medical countermeasur es. We are conti nuing to mon ito r this . Will the vaccine be the solution against Coronavirus? A safe and effective vaccine would be an extremely valuable tool to help stop the spread of infection and prevent future outbreaks. However, proven public health practices of ident ifying cases, isolating patients, and tracing contacts must continue alongside a vaccination program.

Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distrib ution of th e live viru s in the U.S.? There is an interagency working group convened by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response oversee ing samples, and NIH and CDC are central to this . Virus is being deposited in BEi Resources (a NIAID contract resource) for characterization, growth and distrib ution. The WA isolate is available now and a Hong Kong isolate may be added soon. 2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institut ions be permitte d to obtain it directly from oth er sources? Assuming appropriate permits are in place, there is no limitation on an institution obtaining samples directly from BEi or other sources. In a public health emergency, the U.S. government seeks to make isolates availab le under a Simple Letter Agreement that does not impose IP restrictions on academics or developers (see attached language). 3. If it can be obt ained from other sources, wh at sources will be permitt ed? For example, the China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong? Assuming appropriate permits and safety controls, there is no limitation on from where samples can be obt ained . However, there may be intellectual property restrictions from some sources and your technology transfer office would need to negotiate if requested directly. 4. If you are to be th e sole source, w hen would you expect to have a process for considering requests? BEi resources already has a process for sharing in place and is currently sharing the vira l isolate obtained from the first Washington case. NIAID ant icipates that other viral isolates will be obtained soon, and BEi is committed to making those available to the scientif ic community as soon as NIH-001897 

possible. We {NIAID/ USG) do not expect to be the only source, but will likely be one of the main sources for this research resource based on experience w ith Zika. S. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over time)? For that, contacting CDC directly would make sense. If you would like us to inquire, we can. For high consequence viruses, use of proper PPE has been a mitigating factor in quarantine consideration. Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.

Equally, we are interested in highlighting any other public health issues or policies close to Dr. Fauci's heart.

Melanie Melanie Starling Firing Line with Margaret Hoover Cell: (b)(6) Email: melanie@ t hedocumentarygroup.com ABOUT FIRING LINE WITH MARGARET HOOVER Firing Line with Margaret Hoover is a refreshing reprisal of William F. Buckley's iconic PBS program, a smart, civil and engaging contest of ideas. The series maintains the character of the original, providing a platform that is diligent in its commitment to civility and the rigorous exchange of opinion. Firing Line with Margaret Hoover comes at a time when mean ingfu l discourse is needed more than ever.

Showrunner is Emmy, Dupont and Murrow-winning producer Alyssa Litoff. ABOUT MARGARET HOOVER Margaret Hoover is an American political commentator .

With the outbreak of Coronavirus, this has become more vital as surgeon mobility and access to critical surgical spaces in need of more help are severely limited, and specialists will not risk entering spreading viral hot zones. Patient care isn't just a concern with the virus itself, but with the host of medical issues facing patients that will no longer be treated by local specialists easily, and facing caregivers: surgeon involvement from around the world is needed urgently. Although epiqar is an American company, our rollout in recent months has been in France, making selected French institutions the most prepared in the world for remote video care. We obviously weren't anticipating the Coronavirus and now we're dedicated to delivering our technology to where the world needs it asap. epiqar's parent company ENGAUGE (https://eng.us/) is a state-of-the-art online healthcare company for surgeon training and has served clients such as Johnson & Johnson , Intuitive Surgical, and many other of the world largest & smallest medical device companies. ENGAUGE has helped surgeons all over the world have access to secure online training that has improved their understanding of the innovations in robotics and many of the latest surgical techniques and medical devices for best patient care. I've linked a whitepaper below with details of the system's use. Please let me know if you would like to speak further and/or need anything additional. Thanks,

China will have hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus surv ivors . Their convalescent (immune) serum is valuable. China should try to collect it and give it as a good-will gesture to people around the world. For moderately to seriously ill people, Immune serum should save many lives. If cases start to come here, we also should collect serum from survivors, but hopefully we will be very late in t he pandemic, and it is not needed because of all of the others th ings you are doing.

Mathematical Modelling of Natural Ph enomena 2010 ; 5:191-205. Dear Tony, Thank s for your JAMA piece on 2019-nCoV. Perh aps I can help in a small way: In 2003, with SARS, the Ro was initially considered to be over 2, but in fact that was the conflation of the nosocomial and community rates. In the 2004 paper, we showed that nosocomial rate was much higher, and that the Ro in the commun ity was between 1 and 2. A lower Ro in the community accounts for why modera te public health action s could move it toward extinction--and why it propagated in Beijing, but not Shanghai , in Toronto NIH-001957 

NIH-001958 but not in Vancouver--the Ro in North America became less than one pretty quickly. To me, one important aspect is the control of respiratory transmission in the hospital, avoiding extensive nebulization /aerosolization, or doing so in negative pressure rooms, as for TB isolation. (Treating patients with robots is a good idea!) In the communit y, standard public health quarantine, contact tracing should be sufficient for staiie rs. Although hundreds of cases are reported in China, the actual number of infections is likely much higher. The 41 deaths are the tip of the iceberg of not 800 infections (5% fatality rate), but maybe 8,000 infections (0.5%). Although that rate is much better, if the mutating virus becomes very contagious- then the impact could be similar to 1918 flu. That's why containment is so important-and although draconia n, the Chinese government is doing the right thing (as far as we know). When a new pathogen arrives, children often have mild disease but they are important vectors for transmission in the cotrununity , reaching many households. The second paper is the imp01iance of closing schools to minimi ze transmission- This was for flu with a short (pre-symptomatic) incubation , but may be even more relevant for 2019-nCo V. It is much too eai·ly to even think of this in the USA, but it may come to this--and sooner will be better than later, when that time point comes. Happy to help, any way that I can. Thank you for all you and NIAID are doing!!! Best wishes , Marty

Indeed, in 2015 Long et al. (I) found that« ... The common ly used proton pump inhib itors, Om eprazole and Esomep razole were also able to inhibit entry of all PV s tested but at high er drug concentrations than may be achiev ed in vivo ... >>. Using omepra zole and esomeprazole magncsi11m hydrate, prepared in sterile DMSO (Sigma ), they conc luded that« ... OM and ESOM appeared to decrease fluorescence, and therefore increase endosomal pH, only at a concentration of200µM, higher than that required to inhibit PV entry . Moreover cellular toxicity was observed at this concentration after 24 hours ... ». In 2016, Dowa ll et al. (2) found : « ... Whereas omeprazole and esomeprazole demonstrated in vitro activity against EBOV , the results were in line with a previou s report using pseudotyped viruses where the values of drug concentration caus ing 50% inhibition (IC50) were in the region of 50 µM [10). This suggeste d that doses requi red for potent inhibition wou ld be difficult to achieve without concomitant and significant toxicity (the licenced dosing for 40 mg esomeprazole , 20 mg esomep razole and 20 mg omeprazo le generates median maximum plasma concentrations of 1.59- 9.61 ~tM, 0.51-4.78 µMand 0.15-3.51 µM, respectively .. . >>. However, omeprazole is marketed in a non-ionized form and must be ionized (in acidic environment) to be NIH-001963 

NIH-001964 transformed into an active molecule(3). lt is the ionized form which establishes covalent bonds with the SH group of the cysteine of the a subunit of the proton pump. The solution used in 2015 by Jason Long et al. was, as in 2016 by Dowall et al., DMSO(Dimethyl Sulfoxide). DMSO is a polar and aprotic organic solvent with dissociation constant pKa = 35.1 This is probably an explanation for the surprising findings from these studies regarding proton pump inhibitors: Inhibition of viruses at I 00 µM (at 50 µM esomeprazo le for 4 of the 5 viruses tested) and increase in endosomal pH only at a concentration of200 ~1M. This is a situation which, from my point of view, does not reflect the human tissue situation, because in this sin,ation omeprazole can be ionized in the intracellular space but also already in the extrace llular space. Besides, that's probably its advantage: to be ionized and activated where there is an acidic environmen t. Without taking into account the tissue situatio n and the need that omeprazole must be ionized to be transformed into an active molecule, it would not be possible to explain the following publications , since it would be impossible to obtain tissue concentrations required: (5) (6) (10) << Proton pump inhibitors as anti vacuolar-A TPases drugs: a novel anticancer strategy>> (4) << Anti-Rhinovirus activity of lansoprazole, whkh was probably due to an endosomal anti-acidic mechanism » « The use of omeprazole family compounds was associated with a lower probability of influenza-like illness» « PPls exert an antiviral function by effectively inhibiting virus-specific serine proteases>> (7) « Proton pump inhibitors for chronic obstrnctive pulmonmy disease » (8) « The ngH,K-A TPase shares approximately 65% sequence homology with the gH,K-A TPase » (9) « Omeprazole blocked another P-type ATPase, A TP7 A (Men kes protein) in human epidermal melanocytes » « pH-dependent anti tumor activity of proton pump inhibitors» ( 11) « V-ATPase as a candidate target molecrtle or biomarker for cancer treatment and provide a potential role for omeprazole as a chemosensitizer in clear cell carcinoma of the ovaiy » (12) « Proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, used clinically to suppress gastric acidity in gastritis, are activated by acidic conditions and tend to decrease intracellular pH and increase the extrace llular pH via inhibition of V-ATPases in a covalent interaction» ( 13) « proton pump inhibitors have been shown to be highly effective at inhibiting V-ATPases in vitro» (14) Specifically at the pulmonary level, we observe concerning proton pump inhibitors: « ... Since ATP 12A shares approximately 65% identity with the gastric H+/K+-ATPase (ATP4A), we investigated the potential of using clinically approved A TP4A proton pump inhibitors (PPTs) for their ability to restore ASL pH in CF hAECs. We show that, despite not expressing ATP4A transcripts, acute exposure to the PPJ esomeprezo le, produced changes in intracellular pH that were consistent with the inhibition ofH + secretion , but this response was independent of ATP 12A. More importantly , chronic exposu re of CF hAECs to esomeprazo le alka linized the ASL without disrupting the epithe lial barrier integrity, but this increase in ASL pH was consistent with a decrease in mRNA expression of ATPI.2A. We conc lude that PPis may offer a new approach to restore ASL pH in CF airways, which is independent ofCFTR .... » (15) 

NIH-001965 « ... On the other hand, even though the gastric H+/K +-ATPase was not expressed in airway epithelial cells, exposure to esomeprazole acidified the cytosol and increased ASL pH of primary CF hAECs. We show that esomeprazo le had a dual mechanism of action: acutely , it induced intracellular acidification in an ATP l 2A￾independent manner but, chronic exposure, which importantly did not have any deleterious effect on epithelial integrity , was linked to decreased ATP 12A mRNA levels. These results open up the possibility ofrepurposing PPTs as a new therapeutic approach for treating CF lung disease ... » ( 15) « ... we found that the mRNA of ATP 12A, the non-gastric H+/K +-A TPase , shares 70% identity with the gastric H+/K+-ATPase, ATP4A mRNA, which translates to around 65% identity in the protein products ... » (15) « Proton pump inhibitor therapy predisposes to increased risk of developing pneumonia » ( 16) « Na+/H+ Exchangers Are Required for the Development and Function of Vertebrate Mucociliary Epithelia » (17) « ATP4a is required for development and function of the Xenopus mucoci liary epidermis - a potential model to study proton pump inhibitor-associated pneumonia>> (18) Regarding coronaviruses and Golgi complex: « ...

The three main envelope proteins (S, Mand E) are synthesized in the ER and move to the ERGIC/Golgi region where they orchestrate assembly of virus by interacting with the viral nucleocapsid ( ... ).Once virions have budded into the lumen of the ERGlC, the ~ 120 nm particles must move through the host secretory pathway to be released from infected cells. Coronaviruses are believed to follow the constitutive secretory pathway for exocytosis , although only a few stud ies have addressed the release of virions.

Large vacuoles containing budded virions are obse1ved in infected cells, presumably en route to the plasma membrane where fusion of the vacuole results in release of virions ... » (21, 22) « ... It might be worth investigating whether ion-channel inhibitors, such as amantadine, or proton pump inhibitors specifically are able to inhibit this increase in Go lgi pH . For now, though , it still remains to be seen whether Co V release is mediated by viroporin ion channel activity or through PP Is with host proteins of the secretory pathway ... » (23) « V-A TPases are also important for transportation of new ly synthesized acid hydrolases from Golgi to lysosomes » (24) 

NIH-001966 « ... cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin, wbicb are known not to affect tbe transport function ofNa+,K +- AT Pase, inhibited infection of ceUs with MHV, FIPV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and VSV, but not IAV, when the compounds were present during virus inoculation . Card iotonic steroids were shown to inhibit entry ofMHV at an early stage, resulting in accumulation ofvirions close to the cell surface and, as a consequence, in reduced fusion. In agreement with an early block in infection, the inhibition ofVSV by CTSs could be bypassed by low-pH shock. Viral RNA replication was not affected when these compounds were added after virus entry. The antiviral effect of ouabain could be relieved by the addition of different Src kinase inhibitors , indicating that Src signaling mediated via ATPIAI plays a crucial role in the inhibition ofCoV and VSV infections ... » (25) In conclusion, in order to verify the possible efficacy of omeprazole and esomeprazo le in the control of infection by coronaviruses : Tbe equivalent oftbe maximum serum concentration that can be obtained in the human body should be used and tested in active (ionized) form in vitro . Unlike an in vitro test, the human body is an open system, a dissipative system. However, local concentrations oftbe ionized form should not exceed serum concentrations of the inactive non-ionized form in the absence of active transport. But the transfonnation from the non-ionized form to the ionized form could continue until the saturation of the reactions at the cellular ]eve] or until the depletion of the transformation capacity from the inactive form to an active form, linked to a change in acidity or the depletion of the inactive form. As omeprazole can modify or even inhibit the action of the M2 protein of the influenza virus at the cellular level (26), based on a computer simulation test, it would be desirable to cbeck the interaction capabilities of omeprazole with protein E of the corona virus. Protein E is likely to resemb le the protein M2 in its mode of action. In the absence of a treatment recognized as effective in the context of a coronavirus infection and in the absence of data clearly demonstrating the ineffectiveness of omeprazole , personally, l would be tempted to take omeprazole after being in contact (at a distance of less than 2 to 3 meters) with people at risk of contamination or if l had the first symptoms, hoping for the inhibitory activity of omeprazole on P-type ATPases (27, 28) in the context of coronavirus exocytosis, in analogy to the action "off target on the endosoma l v ATPase" during endocytosis processes. This step, if effective, will not prevent infection , but could lessen its importance, slow the process down and give tbe immun e system a complementary option to defend itself... Personal experience, using omeprazole in the context of seasonal respiratory viral infections since 2007, reminds me of the indication to divide the daily dose into two daily doses (omeprazole 10mg morning and evening is usually already effective for seasonal respiratory viral infections). According to tbe evolution and the importance of inflammatory state I associate an antihistamine, eg cetirizine. In the context of the coronavirus , I would be tempted share tbe maximum permissible daily dose of omeprazole in 3 divided doses after being in contact with people at risk of contamination at a distance of less than 2 to 3 meters divide tbe daily dose of omeprazole into two daily doses in case of minor symptoms take the daily dose of omeprazole in a single dose if the symptoms worsen with repercu ssions on the genera l condition to resume the daily dose of omeprazole in two daily doses when the symptoms of severity diminish. The effectiveness of esomeprazole may be greater than omeprazole. 

NIH-001967 Taking into account the aforement ioned publications , it should not be forgotten that omeprazo le will reduce secretions at the respiratory level. A posit ive effect on respiratory secret ions during acute vira l respiratory diseases which can become negative (by modifying the pH, the ciliary mobility and the volume of secretio ns) during prolonged use, thus promoting the risk of bacterial pneumonia (29). The adva ntages and disadvantages may vary depending on the user phenotype of omeprazole with regard to cytochrome P 450 (30). Best regards Johann es Hambura I.

man wears a protective mask while walking in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 10. (Stringer/AFP/Getty Images) By Robert Gebelhoff Assistant editor and Opinions contribu tor Feb. 10, 2020 at 2:22 p.m. EST The latest strain of corona virus continues to rage across Chino. Its death tolf has surpassed 900, eclipsing the body count from Chino's SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003 . To get a better sense of the disease and the U.S. government's response to it, we spoke to Anthony 5. Fauci, immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Below is a transcript of an interview with Fauci, edited for clarity and brevity . Robert Gebelhoff: Right off the bat, what makes this virus different? Anthony Fauci: Well, we have to be concerned whenever there's a virus that has - and I'm going to use a big word here - pathogenic potential. ... [The coronavirus] is brand-new, and there's no real underlying experience with it, so the general population is naive with regard to protection . And it has serious potential, because it's already spreading rapidly . It's the unknown aspect of something that already tells you it's a serious problem. We don' t know where it's going. Gebelhoff : Are we past the point of containment for this coronavirus? Fauci: No, we're not. The short answer is we're not past the point of containment. But it really does have the potential to turn into a global pandemic . What we have now is a very serious epidemic in China .. .. [But outside of China,] there is very little - but some - transmission from person to person . Once you get mult iple countries that have sustained transmission from person to person, then it 's beyond the situation where you can contain it. You can only mitigate it. In the United States, we are clearly in the containment phase .... And what we've done is we've identified . We've isolated . And we've done contact-tracing [identifying who might have come in contact with an infected person]. That seems to be successful. But once it it starts spreading all over the world ... then it's almost inevitable that it's going to start spreading here . Gebelhoff : The Post reported last week that China withheld information from the public, including silencing medical professionals, and that this made the spread of the virus worse. How does the United States work with a governm ent that we can't even trust to tell the tru th to its people? NIH-001983 

Fauci: That is an issue. And it's the reason why I have been saying that we need some of our people - CDC, NIH people - there on the ground , both helping and seeing with their own eyes exactly the extent of this. We want to be part of a [World Health Organization] convening group that goes there. But thus far, we've not been able to make that a reality. Gebelhoff: And why's that? Fauci: I don't know . We have asked. We have colleagues - scientific colleagues - in China that we've dealt with for years if not decades. Many of them have trained in the United States. And we know them as friends and as colleagues. They are the ones that are not holding back .... But they're not the ones that make the official proclamations of what comes out. The solution to the problem in the question you're posing is that we really do want people there, so that we can not only help them but also provide some expertise that might supplement or complement their own expertise. Gebelhoff: What does the United States do if [the coronavirus] does become a pandemic in the developing world? Fauci: Well obviously we will try to help them to contain as best as possible .... Right now, by definition, it is not truly a global pandemic. It is a very serious outbreak and epidemic in China, but the amount of sustained transmission outside of China is still minimal. ... But there are some countries where it is going to be very difficult to stop the evolution into sustained transmission. Obviously the [World Health Organization] and the global security network that we put up over the years will try to help those countries, but there's no guarantee that we'll be successful. Gebelhoff: On that point, the head of the WHO has crit icized travel bans and restrictions around the world as not helpful to stopping the outbreak. He said it was potentially "increas ing fear and stigma." What Fauci: Everyone agrees that travel bans and restrictions are almost never successful In completely stopping something is that invariably going to turn into a pandemic .... What we are trying to do is to pause temporarily and give China enough time to put the lid on [th is virus] to prevent it from becoming global and to give us a little more time to prepare. There's no indication or imagination that if this becomes a global pandemic that travel restrictions are going to mean anything . But they can mean something , as a temporizing activity. Gebelhoff : What should the average person be doing right now about coronavirus? Fauci: It's a good question . 1) They should realize at this point, it is a low risk. And 2) that risk can change, so pay attention to what's going on [and] to the ... announcements coming from the CDC. ... The things that you do for influenza - get vaccinated, wash your hands, avoid crowded places - are exactly the same things that you would do if we did get coronavirus here. So the question is, should we do anything different from what we're already doing? No. Should we all be wearing a mask? Absolutely not.

I know that you are very busy, and I am sorry to bother you. You probably already knew what I'm going to say and appear to be so relaxed. With the significant concern for the quick spread of coronavirus infect ion, I would like to propose a cell￾based immunomodulation strategy to reduce the "cytokine storm", the main pathophysiologcal cause for t he mortal ity . The scientific rationale regarding this strategy has been parti ally discussed in an art icle entitled " Extending the Horizon of Cell Based lmmunotherapy by Understand ing the Mechanisms of Actio n of Photopheresis" and ot her related arti cles on this topic . Several potent ial treatment modal ity could be derived from th is concept if more laboratory and clinical data support this motion , which include : (1) ozone therapy ( w ithdraw about SO ml -100 ml blood from patie nt in transfusion bag, mix ing with small amount of ozone ex vivo and re-infuse back to pat ient in 30 minutes); (2) Cupping therapy (medically ind uced subcutaneous hemorrhage by heat and vacuums effec ts) to expose self ant igens to the abundant dendrit ic cells in the subcutaneous tissue in order to reinforce the self ant igen tolerance . The best t iming for these interventions in theory would be at the NIH-001986 

NIH-001987 period of fever, viremia stage. These simple approaches can be incorporated with the other medical treatments and support ive care. I cannot be certain, but want to help as a holistic physician. Thank you very much for reading this email and providing your insight as well as help. Sincerely, Ching Y. Voss, M.D.

I would like to invite you to participate in a conversation at the meeting on responding to the coronavirus and global pandemics . As you may know, the Trilateral Commission was launched by David Rockefeller in 1973 to think through the shared challenges and leadership responsibi lities of the three principal industrialized democratic areas of the world: Europe, North American, and Japan (now Asia). Today, the Commission believes its original mission of bring ing democrat ic countries together to tackle international challenges should once again be a majo r priority for our country and our partners . This year's plenary meeting is a major, three - day gathering of our global membership during which we will explore the theme "Democracy and Capitalism at a Crossroads." NIH-001990

Conrad, Patricia (NIH/NIAID) [El RE: Heat kills novel Coronavirus The following is all on background. Coronaviruses in general tend to circulate and infe ct predominantly in the winter season {Northern and Southern hemispheres have opposite seasons). We do not know for sure why th is is t he case; however , many believe that the enclosed spaces in winter {mostly indoor because it is cold) allows better spread of a respiratory borne virus. Also, some viruses tend to thrive in cold, dry weather as opposed to warm, mo ist weather. Remember, however, that when it is summer here , it is winter in Australia and Argentina . This may be the genesis of the information given to President Xi and President Trump that the virus may "go away" in the warm weather. However , this is a brand new virus with which we have no prior experience and it is entirely conceivable that seasonal changes will not have any impact on the spread. Hope t hat this is helpful.

NIH-001993 Dr. Fauci: We've been seeing a lot about people saying the heat will kill the novel coronavirus? Is this medically sound? Trump discussed Coronavirus briefly: He said he had a long talk with President Xi two nights ago, and the Chinese president told him "the heat generally kills this kind of virus." The president claimed the virus will go away in April as the seasons change: "The virus that we're talking about having to do a lot of people. We think that goes away in April with the heat," he said. Eric M. Strauss, ABC News Managing Editor, Medical Unit www.ericmstrauss .com Phone: 212-456 -2016 Connect on Social: T/1/F = @ericMstrauss

You may have seen this: https:/fwww .nzherald.co . nz/wor ld/news/article.cfm?c id=2&objecti d= 12307276 Is this news? Don' t we already know that the virus spread via droplet transmission? This article says aerosol transmissio n means "it can float a long distanc e to the air and cause infection later when it is breathed in." Tha t makes it so und like the kind of spread that happ ens with measles, where the v irus can linger in a room and infect some body 2 hours after some body with measles leaves the room. Tomorrow, I will be giving an hour an d a half of affiliate debriefings on this virus. So we wi ll be reaching millions of people. I'd love to get the latest and greatest public health message . Incidentally, Howard Zucker and the infect ious disease folks at NYU Langone are very concerned about overloading our emergency rooms with patients who have upper respiratory infection symptoms. What is the right message? If somebody calls thinking they have coronavirus , do you tell them to come in - risking infection of othe rs? Do they stay home and wait for symptoms to get wo rse? Of course , it would be grea t if you could send them a kit and happen to home testing . But that 's nowhere in the n ear future , right ? NIH-001998

I did not know that. Good talking point for press conferences. From: Folkers, Greg (NIH/N IAID) [E) (b)(6) Se nt: Sunday, February 9, 2020 1:13 PM Subject: lnvestigat ional compound remdesivir, developed by UAB and NIH researchers, being used for treatment of novel coronavirus lnvestigational compound remdesivir, developed by UAB and NIH researchers, being used for treatment of novel coronavirus by Savannah Koplon • February 07, 2020 • Print • Email ___ --- - ,Richard Whitley, M .0., Distinguished Professor at UAB and principal investigator of the U19 grant The investigationa l drug remdesivir, developed through research conducted through the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Cent er, or AD3C, and centered at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is being used to treat select infected patients in the United States and in China who have been affected by the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). UAB was awarded a $37.5 million, five-year U19 grant from the Nati onal Instit ute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Centers of Excelle nce fo r Translat ional Research to study and develop treatment for high-priority emerging infections. Work has been taking place in earnest to develop drugs for emerging influenza, flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile virus and Zika), coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, and alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and chikungunya. The grant is a multi - NIH-002021 

NIH-002022 institutional collaboration to accelerate drug discovery for these emerging infections and is a public￾private partnership between academic institutions and Gilead Sciences. Remdesivir, developed to treat the coronavirus causing MERS, was found to have significant activity against the 2019-nCoV strain when the outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Importantly, remdesivir had demonstrated efficacy in treating other medically important coronav iruses MERS and SARS in cell culture and animal models . Based on the compassionate plea requests of treating physicians in the United States, Gilead Sciences released remdesivir for use in a few patients, although the drug has not yet been tested for safety or efficacy in these diseases. "The release of remdesiv ir for safety and efficacy studies is a major accompl ishment for the AD3C - namely the U 19 grant - as it shows significant and swift advance of antiv iral drugs to help treat and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks on an international scale and, importantly, to anticipate the introduction of these infections in the United States," said Richard Whitley , M.D., Distinguished Professor at UAB and princ ipal investigator of the U19 grant. WATCH: UAB infectious disease expert s prov ide info rmat ion on the 2019 novel coronav irus. Gilead Sciences and supporting researchers and clinicians are working with health authorities from the World Health Organization and in China to establish a placebo-controlled study to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating 2019-nCoV. "This is a prime example of how the research we are conducting at UAB plays a critical role in treating patients on a global scale and our contribution of substantial scientific advances." - Richard Whitley, M.D., UAB Distinguished Professor "The collaboration between UAB, our colleagues at Southern Research, Vanderbilt University and the University of North Carolina, along with our pharmaceutical partner Gilead Sciences, is indicative of our collaborat ive approach to respond to outbreaks in real time, and in helping commun ities worldwide fight 2019-nCoV. This is a prime example of how the research we are conducting at UAB plays a critical role in treat ing patients on a global scale and our contribution of substantial scientific advances," Whitley continued . Whitley expressed that the potent ial for mutation of 2019-nCoV means that UAB's AD3C and partners wi ll need to build backup molecules for potential testing and treatment in the near future. The World Health Organization has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern ." UAB is the lead institution for AD3C and research conducted; but the team unifies scientists experienced in virology, viral immunology, pathogenesis, medicinal chemistry and trans lation to human disease from UAB, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, Emory University, Washington University , The University of Texas Medical Branch, Southern Research, the Emory Institute of Drug Discovery, the University of Colorado, Denver, and Oregon Health & Science University.

I know you must be very busy. Our editor, Dr. Elizabeth Rosenthal, is wondering whether the new coronavirus might be spreading through plumbing on the cruise ship? She sent me these links, below, about how plumbing played a role in spreading SARS in the Amoy Gardens apa1tment complex in Hong Kong. Libby lived in China during the SA.RS outbreaks and remembers that the sinks there don't have the typ ical U-bend trap that sinks have here, which allows sewer gases and unpleasant odors to come through. If plumbing is a risk for spreading coronavimses, what could be done to protect passengers on cruise ships? T'd love to hea r your thoughts on this, even if just by email. Thanks for your time.

Please let me know if you have any suggested edits, and I'll move it along. Thanks, Kathy Enrica Battifoglia Science and Technology Head Editor ANSA news agency (Italian news) Enrica .Batt ifogl ia@ansa .it Expected place of publication: ANSA Science web page (www .ansa.it/scienza ) Dear Professor Fauci, I am Enrica Battifoglia of the Italian news agency ANSA, I already have had the ple asure to interview you several times at the AIDS world conferences. I would like to ask you some questions about Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, to be published on the ANSA Science web page (www.ansa.it/scienza ), the main online science news resource in Italy with over 1.5M contacts each month. I am sure that your clarity and competence will be highly valuable to put some much-needed order among so many contrasting news and data, and would be much appreciat ed by our readers . NIH-002039 

NIH-002040 1. Do the current available data allow to understand the threat level of coronavirus 2019- nCoV in terms of both lethality and diffusion speed, and about the possible evolution scenarios of the disease? There is much that we do not know about the novel coronav irus. Curre ntly, there have been more than 37,000 confirmed cases in China, and China has reported more than 800 deaths. As you know, there have been three confirmed cases in Italy to date. The reported case fatality rate (lethality) among the 37,000 cases that have come to the attention of the health care system is 2%. However , given that there are likely many more cases that are without symptoms or with minimal symptoms, the actual death rate is probably lower than 2%. It is impossible to predict how the virus will evolve. It is our hope that the extraordinary containment measures that China has implemented will help prevent the outbreak from becoming a global pandemic. But given that the virus is present in 27 countries to date and can be transmitted from person-to-person, it may take a footho ld and evolve into a global pandemic . 2) What exactly do we know about its modes of transmission, especially from people who do not yet have the symptoms? Again, there is much that we do not know about the novel coronavirus, including its specific transmission abilities. Based on initial findings that have been reported, we suspect its transmission is similar to influenza and other respiratory viruses, namely that is transm itted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by touching surfaces, such as door handles, that recently have virus on them and then touching your face. There have also been reports that the virus is present in feces and vomit. However, it is still uncertain that the virus can be transmitted through this route. Traditionally, most viruses are transmitted when someone has symptoms. With the novel coronavirus; however, there appears to be asymptomatic transmission occurring. We do not know how many cases are being driven by asymptomatic transmission or by those with symptoms . Typically, viruses are largely transmitted by infected peop le experiencing symptoms. 3) Are the genetic sequences provided by China enough to start working on a vaccine? The genetic sequences provided by China enabled researchers to quickly deve lop a diagnostic that is being used to dete1mine whether someone is infected with the novel coronavirus. The genetic information has also been useful in work to develop a preventive vaccine. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. Natio nal Institutes of Health, is building on its experience with the SARS and MERS corona viruses to better understand the virus as well as develop and test rapid point-of-care diagnostics , vaccines and treatments, including broad-spectrum antivirals and antibody therapies. In terms of vaccines specifically , we are 

NIH-002041 working with the biotechnolog y company Moderna and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to develop a "messenger RNA" vaccine for the novel coronav irus. Other countries and companies are working to develop a vaccine as well. 4) What are the technical times to develop a working vaccine in terms of scientific research, and what are the approx times for the necessary legal certifications, and for industrial production and distribution? In terms of our work with Moderna and CEPI to develop a vaccine , we anticipate having an experimental vaccine ready for Phase 1 clinical trials within 2 to 3 months. This Phase 1 clinical trial will involve administering the vaccine to a sma ll number of healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and has some ability to induce an immune response. If that is successful and the outbreak has not ended, we will move to a larger Phase 2 clinical trial with the expectation of proving the efficacy (or not) of the vaccine within 1 to 1.5 years. If efficacious, it will still take additional months to produce enough vaccine to distribute widely .. In addition to this vaccine, NIAID is also supporting scientists and companies to develop other vaccine candidates. 5) 2019-nCov is the third Coronavirus aggressive for humans that has appeared in the East in the last 20 years and in 2009 the virus responsible for the flu pandemic too did come from China: what sort of preventive measures could be practicable to reduce the risk of repetition of these events? To clarify, the 2009 HlNl influenza virus was first reported in Mexico, not China. Viruses affecting humans have occurred throughout history, from the Bubonic Plague to the 1918 flu. We cannot predict what emerging infectious diseases will occur nor prevent the unknown from occurring in the first place. What we can do is learn as much as we can about emerging viruses, so that we can rapidly develop safe and effective point-of-care diagnostics, treatments and vaccines to protect against infection.

Each year we host a Health Care Conference in Boston in March that attracts 200+ companies and 1000+ investors. During this year's conference, we had planned to host a one-hour panel discussion on the evolution of and reforms within the China Health Care System and China Pharmaceutical market. However, given global concerns around Coronavirus, we have decided to focus the panel instead on the virus and the outlook for emerging treatments. This perspective is critical to health care companies and therefore the institutions that invest in them. Our panel will take place during Cowen 's 40th Annual Health Care Conference, which will be held at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston on March 2-4, 2020. We plan to host this panel on Monday morning, March 2nd, between 9:05-10:0SAM. Attendees at our conference include institutional investors from insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and other types of funds, mainly in the U.S. and EU. Cowen would provide you an honorarium for your time during the one-hour panel. We propose an honorarium of $1,500, and we reimburse conference-related travel expenses. The discussion will be Q&A only and no presentation on your part is requested . We look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Steve Scala NIH-002042

Subject: Royal Society of Medicine londo n Hello Dr Fauci, By way of introduction , 1 was Jim Mac Lowry 's last fellow at the NIH and have been work ing in the UK since then as a medi cal microbio logist and hospital epidemio logist. J am the lead medical microbiologist at the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK and was wondering about your availabili ty please to speak at a conference on emergent Coronavirus threats to be held at the RSM on November 24th coming? The RSM is a unigue educa tional cha1ity here and we have councils covering all aspects of healthcare. The program is still developing but I wanted to check on your availability quickly- we have an academ ic fond to which I can apply to cover your trip but will need to do so soon. Jt was both exciting and inspirational being a senior staff fellow at the Nll-1 - my background is international; (b) (6) and the internationa l perspective s --,------------,---,-,,-----,-....,...,.,...-----,,--,-,--- at the NIH were so encouraging. All non- American fellows recognised the nationa l strateg ic remit of the NIH for the US , but I have often wondered if an assessment has ever been made of how fellows like myself have brought the spirit of that institution to other nations.

We wonder if you might have any perspective (or might recommend someone to commen t) for a novel coronavirus story we are writing for this weekend, regarding vaccine efforts . In short, we wonder how you see an eventual vaccine playing a role in the future of the outbreak? CDC has described the virus as not mutating as much as influenza -- does that suggest a vaccine would provide more than seasonal protection? In the long te rm, we had a few other questions. Is thi s something you could see added to the MM R protoco l for the general public, or only in regions where there are local outbreaks (is there an analogy to SARS or MERS vaccines in this contemplated use)? Is the re any aspect of a race against time in vaccine development if this coronavirus is seasonal like influenz a? We are basically trying to understand where a vaccine fits into the future response to this new virus. we asked you these sort of questions about the Zika vaccine efforts and your perspective really helped a lot. Apologies for all the quest ions, if you had any perspective, we'd be grateful Dan Vergano BuzzFeed News (b)(6) cc: Kathy Stover Dan Verg ano I Science Desk (DC) I BuzzFeed News (b)(6) ----- 1630 Connecticut Ave. 7th Floor, Washington DC 20009 Send secure tips -- contact .buzzfeed.com NIH-002089

John and Jim French drugmaker Sanofi workin g on coronavirus initiative CHINA-HEALTH/SANOFI (PIX):French drugmaker Sanofi working on coronavirus initiative PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi will announce a new coronavirus initiative within the next two weeks, its chief executive said on Thursday, adding that it wants to present something concrete and not add to "fantasies". At least a dozen drngmake rs are working on vaccines or antivira ls to help those infected with the fast-spreading virus that has killed more than 500 people in China, but several have warned that development of treatments will take time. NIH-002105 

NIH-002106 "We have seen a flurry of activities from other companies," CEO Paul Hudson told a news conference after Sanofi published 2019 results on Thursday. "We are one of the few companies that has the expe1iise to know when it is just a fantasy, or when it could be real. In the next week or two, you will see something more confinnatory about the approach we will take." Hudson declined to give further details. Sanofi had already said it was sharing its expertise and data acquired from other outbreaks with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is working with biotech businesses to try to develop a vaccine candidate for the coronavirus. Britain's GlaxoSmithKline is also collaborating with CEPI. "The objective here is not a newspaper headline, it is real work that will make a difference ," Hudson said.

Given your most recent appointment , I wanted to show you the courtesy of letting you know what I have alread y provided to senior leaders at the White House regarding a possible mitigating strategy until the definitive solution to the CoV is available and implemented. The string below includes additional information as to how titanium dioxide can fit into both the White House and the National / International solutions, and the open-source website for the company. Please keep in mind that because this product is already approved and in use in the EU for a variety of commercial uses, the data provided does not specifically address the applications I, and you, are interested in. Ho-\ivever, with a deep understanding of the White House mission, I can say that there is not a big leap in that thought migration. Dr. Jackson has already provided the same material to some of your White House Commission colleagues. I will also be reaching out to another friend of mine from the Bush-now-Trump Administration, Steve Biegun. NIH-002121 

I encourage your representatives to meet with the company leadership and scientists while they are in the US next week. Please let me know if you have any questions that I can address. Thank you for once again stepping up to the plate for our Country. v/r Dick ps .. .I remembered this morning where you and I last spoke--Bush (41) funeral. ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Richard Tubb (b) (6) > ----------- Date: Thu, Jan 30, 2020 at 8:54 AM Subject: Re: Pandemic Threat Reduction Good morning Gentlemen, I just spoke with Ronny and believe I need to offer A relevant update and one point of explanation. First, the company's joint venture partner in India is meeting with the Indian government as we speak. It appears likely that in light of the news of India's introduction to the corona virus the government will utilize their "Natio nal Catastrophe Budget" to expedite the funding necessary to secure and execute a contract with this company. Secondly, I w ill attach the open source web site for the company to provide you background information that, out of respect for your time and for the sake of brevity, I left out of yesterday's note. It's important to note a couple of things: This product is already proved and is in use in the EU with all the approvals appropriate for the same. Secondly, in our language, this is a "standoff produ ctr'' -I.e. you apply it once and it continues to decontamina te and disinfect in the background for up to 1-5 years before retreating. (Depending on the type of use, norma l daily cleaning using their cleaning solution-that is cheaper and more effective than what the application normally would use, e.g. in a hotel-cont inues). The chemical treats anything organic, I.e. bacteria, viruses, voe, bio threats, etc. because it is a catalyst, it is neither used up, nor NIH-002122 

does it produce microbial resistance or superbugs. It decontaminates and disinfects surfaces (e,g, airplanes and government critical infrastructures) and the air around the surface (and HVAC fi lters and air handlers). The leadership will be in DC next week. I highly encourage any and all potential stakeholders make time to meet with them while they are here. To that end, I had already emailed Dr. Fauci (with whom I worked a great deal on similar chalenges during the Bush Admin istrat ion) before the announcement of his participat ion on the new coronavirus commission, I will also reach out to an old friend and colleague Steve BIEGUN now that he is in the commission . Please feel free to forward the information to others as you deem appropr iate . Thanks, Dick Tubb htt ps://act.g lobal/ Ps ... once again, in my haste to get this to you , via iPad, please forgive typos and other apparent crimes against the dictionary .

NIH-002124 In light of the current and evolving threat presented by the corona virus, I am writing to you as a courtesy to inform you of a project that Admiral Jackson, Dr. Hofmann, and I have been consulting on. We believe so strongly in the technology, people, and potential that we have been consulting pro bono and currently have no financial stake in the project. While not developed specifically designed for such purposes, I increasingly believe that until a vaccination and treatment for the corona virus is available, this technology may be the last best chance in containing, and eradicating the virus, thereby protecting the homeland, our economy, the Continuity of the Presidency, an Enduring Constitutional Government, our people and our Country. Moreover, reverting to my "lessons-learned, problems-ahead" statement, even after this crisis is over, and a vaccine and treatment procured, it will only be a matter of time until "next time." This letter is proof-positive of that reality. My experiences, especially in the early 2ooo's (e.g. anthrax and other biothreats, SARs, etc.) underpin my beliefs. The technology that provides the solution, both now and in the future, involves a unique formulation of a photo catalytic 

NIH-002125 nano titanium dioxide solution (the Air Force guys will, of course, understand what that means, so you non-Air Force folks, just buy them a beer and they'll explain it to you) that is safer, more effective, and more cost effective than any other solution. It was developed and approved in the EU, and I have asked the senior leadership of the company to come to Washington DC next week. Dr. Hofmann and I spent the day yesterday with a Chinese "titan" respected by and with access to the most senior government officials, academic and medical giants, and investment and industry captains. I have encouraged , and he has agreed in principal, to follow our recommendations as they relate to their largest airline, and their key facilities. In short, our strategic priority is to first fortify the weak link in the pandemic chain: the airlines. Doing so will provide the time necessary to isolate, contain, and ultimately destroy the threat at its source (Wuhan) ,and in its home (China). As President Bush so commonly stated about a very different threat, we need to fight the battle over there, so that we don't have to fight the battle here. Although President Bush was a true believer in the threat of a pandemic, I believe this threat, and the 

NIH-002126 threats that are surely to fallow are, in reality , many, many times greater than the threat he envisioned when making that statement. By fighting a possible impending pandemic at its source we will preserve and protect the safety and confidence of our people, and the strength of our economy. Once we have interrupted the threat supply chain, we can then shore up our critical infrastructure using the same technology and process, then assist the Chinese in addressing their challenges, and protect our international allies elsewhere . In that vein, in addition to the Chinese, I have also discussed this technology and strategy with senior proxies for another of my former patients, His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and his father, the King. As I noted above , I have asked the leadership of the company to come to Washington (from Germany and Denmark) next week for a variety of meetings. While Admiral Jackson will be "tied up in Texas" for the foreseeable future, please let me know if you would like to meet with myself or Dr. Hofmann, or the company 

NIH-002127 leadership while they are here, to learn more. Thank you and my best to you all as you plan for and continue to protect our Country, Very Respectfully, Dick Tubb ps. For your SA, I have also attached below the latest sit rep on the coronavirus. Richard J. Tubb, MD Brigadier General (retired) White House Physician Emeritus Shoreland's Travax News Alert Service￾Abbreviated China: More than 2,800 Cases of 2019-nCoV in 30 Provinces/Municipalities , Mainly in Wuhan ; Cases Exported to 16 Countries WHAT'S NEW According to regional health authorities, more than 1,800 additional , confirmed cases (including 25 deaths) of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported since January 27, 2020, throughout the country, mainly in the provinces of Hubei (1,291), Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), and Hunan (143) and in the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (19), and Shanghai (13). Most new cases had a travel history to Wuhan . Almost all the recent deaths occurred in Hubei Province. Twenty more patients have recovered and been 

NIH-002128 discharged. More than 4,600 confirmed cases (including> 100 deaths) have occurred since December 8, 2019. A total of 13 additional , exported, confirmed cases have been reported (through January 28, 2:00 p.m. EST) since Monday, January 27. More than 25 cases have been exported in the past 7 days. Cases reported since Monday arrived in the following countries on the dates shown: Singapore (January 19 and 23), Taiwan (January 22), Japan (January 20 and 21 ), France (arrival date unknown), and Thailand (arrival dates unknown). All of these cases had travel history to Wuhan or contact with an ill person from Wuhan while in China . In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been reported since Monday in Germany (4), Japan , Taiwan and Vietnam. The cases in Japan, Taiwan , and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously ill person from China. In Germany all 4 cases had close contact in a business seminar with an apparently asymptomatic Chinese woman on January 21 (who previously had contact with relatives from Wuhan) ; the women states symptom onset was on a flight to Shanghai on January 23, and she was later confirmed to have 2019-nCoV. Incubation periods in these cases have been as short as 3 days. In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting, the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China is increasingly justified. Updated travel advisories include: 1) Australia: reconsider travel to China; 2) Canada: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 3) Finland: avoid nonessential travel to Hubei Province; 4) France: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 5) Germany: avoid nonessential travel to China and avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 6) India: avoid all nonessential travel to China; 7) New Zealand: avoid all travel to Hubei Province ; 8) Taiwan: avoid all nonessential travel to China. Singapore now denies entry to residents of Hubei Province and those who have traveled there in the past 14 days. Mongolia and 3 regions (Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, Yevreyskaya Oblast) in Far Eastern Federal District, Russia have closed their land borders with China. Bangladesh , Canada, India, Kazakhstan , Russia, and South Korea are arranging flights to repatriate their respective citizens from Wuhan. These persons will be closely monitored and present little threat of onward transmission. All tourist attractions in Tibet Autonomous Region have been closed . Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return. Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in central China; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain. 

NIH-002129 OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT The epidemic in China is months from peaking . A report indicates that just prior to the cordoning off of Wuhan, over 5 million residents (many potentially infectious) left for other parts of China, and many thousands left for Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. Exported cases have so far been to countries likely to be capable of controlling (but not preventing) ongoing transmission, which will inevitably occur. In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting , the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China is increasingly justified. Based on increasing data on virology, clinical presentation, and transmission, this coronavirus closely resembles SARS-CoV in many behaviors. Fortunately , sequential sequencing of viral isolates over time indicate no significant new viral mutations ; mutations often increase transmission or virulence . WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very high in China , high at the regional level, and high at the global level. The closing of Wuhan airport and the major cities of Hubei province have yet to stem the flow of exported cases . The originally implicated animal market, now closed indefinitely, bears little relevance to the ongoing situation. Whether the market was the focus of a species jump from animals to humans or merely one of multiple amplification settings for initial cases is increasingly unclear. The degree of human-to-human spread outside of Hubei province remains unclear . A reproductive number, Ro, is estimated at 1.4-2 .5 by Chinese authorities and up to 5.5 by other scientists . An Ro greater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case, making control much more difficult. The spectrum of disease manifestations in a large cohort study has yet to be disclosed; a severe case rate of 20% has been consistent. The existence of mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious cases could increase the risk of global spread. Case fatality is impossible to ascertain at present, and lesser or greater clinical virulence compared to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV remains speculative.

Current Disease Situation More than 4,600 confirmed cases (976 severe and critical cases and 106 deaths) have occurred since December 8, 2019, in the provinces of Hubei (> 2,700; mainly in Wuhan), Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), Hunan (143), and Anhui (106); in the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (91 ), and Shanghai (66); and in 21 other provinces throughout the country. An additional 6,900 suspected cases have been reported since January 21, 2020. In the setting of a large outbreak and with increased delays in testing, a high proportion of suspected cases will evolve into confirmed cases. Seventy-nine cases have been discharged. Two-thirds of the cases are male. The youngest case is 10 years old and the oldest is 89; more than 70% of cases are over 40 years old, but the co-morbidity profiles of most cases are unknown . 

NIH-002132 The number of persons becoming infected with the virus has been doubling every six days. The outbreak in China is not approaching peak, and modeling indicates that is months away. Exported Cases Seventy-seven imported cases of 2019-nCoV (confirmed after arrival) presented at international ports of entry January 6-25 in 16 countries. Of these cases, more than 25 cases arrived in the past 7 days. All 77 cases had exposure in Wuhan or exposure to ill persons from Wuhan in China and symptom onset dates after December 31, 2019; none had visited the implicated market. Australia (5 cases): One case traveled while asymptomatic aboard China Southern Airlines flight CZ231 to Melbourne, Victoria State on January 19 and was hospitalized on January 23. Contact tracing is underway ; movement around Melbourne was limited prior to isolation. The remaining 4 cases traveled while asymptomatic aboard flights to Sydney, New South Wales State on January 6, 18, 20, and 23, and were hospitalized on January 15, 20, and 24. One of the patients had limited movement around Sydney prior to isolation; movement history for the other 3 cases is unknown.

Contact tracing for all cases is underway. The first case reported limited movement around Chicago prior to hospitalization; movement history for the other 2 cases in unknown. Vietnam (1 case): The case arrived in Hanoi on January 13 and was hospitalized on January 22 in Ho Chi Minh City. In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been reported since Monday in Germany (4), Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The cases in Japan , Taiwan, and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously ill person from China. In Germany, all 4 cases had close contact in a business seminar with an apparently asymptoma tic Chinese woman on January 21 (who previously had contact with relatives from Wuhan); the woman states symptom onset was on a flight to Shanghai on January 23, and she was later confirmed to have 2019-nCoV . Incubation periods in these cases have been as short as 3 days. Entry/Exit Screening 

NIH-002134 In a reversal of long-standing policy , WHO now recommends that all countries implement temperature screening at points of entry for passengers arriving from 2019- nCoV-affected countries. Screening should be accompanied by dissemination of risk￾communication messages at points of entry to later capture asymptomatic persons who are in the incubation phase. In early January , some exit screening was implemented at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport (nonstop flights to Istanbul, London, New York, Osaka, Paris, Rome, San Francisco, Tokyo, and major hubs throughout Southeast Asia), as well as at 3 major rail stations in Wuhan . More restrictive screening was instituted on January 15 in Hubei until cessation of international flights on January 23. Despite exit screening at all international airports in China in the past week, significant numbers of cases continue to be exported. Entry screening at international ports of entry has been or is being implemented as noted below, and anyone with fever and respiratory symptoms who has been to 2019- nCoV-affected areas in the previous 14 days will be detained and isolated at these locations: Algeria: Houari Boumediene Airport, Mohamed Boudiaf International Airport , Oran Ahmed Ben Balla Airport Burma (Myanmar) : Yangon International Airport Egypt: Cairo International Airport (all flights from China) Hong Kong: All border checkpoints , including Hong Kong International Airport and the railway station in West Kowloon India: Bengaluru , Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad , Kochi, Kolkata, and Mumbai international airports (all flights from China and Hong Kong) Italy: Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport Iran: Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport (all flights from China) Macau: Macau International Airport North Macedonia: Skopje International Airport (connecting flights from Asia) Qatar: Hamad International Airport (all flights from China) Russia: Moscow, Irkutsk Oblast, and Yekaterinburg international airports and points of entry in Amur Oblast Singapore : Changi Airport South Africa : O.R. Tambo International Airport (all flights from China) South Korea : lncheon International Airport Taiwan: All international airports 

NIH-002135 Thailand : Krabi, Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang , Phuket, and Chiang Mai airports Turkey: All international airports (all flights from China) United Arab Emirates: Abu Dhabi International Airport and Dubai International Airport (all flights from China) U.K.: Heathrow International Airport U.S.: Twenty points of entry, including Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport , O'Hare International Airport , and San Francisco International Airport. Travelers from Wuhan may have their temperatures taken and/or be required to complete a symptom questionnaire; travelers with symptoms (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) will be deta ined for additional assessment.

Land Borders with China Closed : Kyrgyzstan , Mongolia , North Korea, Russia (Amur Oblast , Khabarovsk Krai, Jewish Autonomous Oblast in Far Eastern Federal District); high speed rails and ferry services suspended in Hong Kong No Residents from Hubei Province: Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore (including visitors in past 14 days), Malaysia , and Taiwan 

NIH-002136 Internal Travel Restrictions in China: Major cities in Hubei Province have instituted a travel ban on occupants of their cities, suspending urban buses, subways , ferries , and long-distance passenger transport from the cities, including flights and trains , and closing intercity roads. lnterprovince shuttle buses in major areas have stopped. Many bars, restaurants, shops, and museums are closed in Hubei Province, Guangdong , and many other affected areas. Major tourist attractions have closed in Beijing, Shanghai , Sanya (Hainan Province), Hong Kong, and Tibet Autonomous Region. China has stopped all inbound and outbound tour groups but not individual travel. Internal travel for the Lunar New Year Holiday has been severely limited by the government , and public gatherings are forbidden. The reopening of schools and universities has been postponed in many areas. Shanghai has temporarily closed all nonessential workplaces. Visitors from Hubei Province will be actively monitored for 14 days in Haikou, Hainan Province. No Flights from 2019-nCoV-Affected Countries: Travelers going to Samoa must spend at least 14 days in a country free of 2019-nCoV and undergo medical clearance prior to travel to Samoa. Australia , Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Kazakhstan , Morocco, Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, U.K., and U.S. are arranging flights to repatriate their respective citizens from Wuhan. These persons will be closely monitored and present little threat of onward transmission . Transmission The detailed epidemiology of possible causative animal exposures and zoonotic transmiss ion remains unclear. Many (27 of 41) earlier cases were directly linked to South China Seafood City market in Jianghan District, which sold seafood and other wildlife (including birds). More than 580 environmental samples , without indication as to whether animal tissue was included , were collected from the implicated market. Of these , 33 tested positive for 2019-nCoV , indicating that the market was an-or the-origin point of the large-scale outbreak. Thirty-one of the positive samples (94%) were collected from the western part of the market, where wildlife was traded. The first published epi-curve shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified in the outbreak was December 1, 2019. The patient reported no exposure to the implicated market; no epidemiological link has been detected between this case and later cases. This finding raises the possibility of an initial jump of 2019-nCoV directly from bat to human, with subsequent initial human-to-human propagation within the seafood market. Infected intermediate animal hosts, if they exist, may still be present in the supply chain. South China Seafood City market, now closed indefinitely , remained in operation through December 31, 2019. Other points of infection would be likely because many subsequent cases had no contact with the implicated market. Chinese authorities have now stated that human-to-human transmission is in the fourth generation in Wuhan and at least the second generation elsewhere (mostly in clusters). A reproductive number, Ro, is estimated at 1.4-2.5by Chinese authorities and at up to 5.5 by some scientists. An R0greater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case, making control much more difficult. Ro is not a constant number and changes with the ongoing circumstances and evolution of an outbreak . One published cluster study indicates asymptomatic shedding (but not transmission) by a single patient. Sequence data from several small clusters indicate identical virus in all subjects within the cluster. 

NIH-002137 More than 47,800 close contacts remain under surveillance (> 1,200 have been released), and contact tracing is ongoing in affected provinces and municipalities. However, not all contacts are being ascertained or monitored adequately. As many as 16 health care workers (HCWs) have been confirmed as infected by at least 1 case in Wuhan in a potential super-spreading event, but overall infectivity for HCWs has not been established. No case of 2019-nCoV has been attributed to transmission on an aircraft . The survival rate of the virus on surfaces or in the environment is unknown. Disinfection processes that are effective for other zoonotic coronaviruses should be followed for now. Clean daily all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tables, and bedside tables. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, bodily fluids, and/or secretions or excretions on them. Use a diluted bleach solution or a household disinfectant with a label that says "EPA-approved ." To make a bleach solution, add 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of bleach to 1 l (1 quart) of water; for a larger supply, add 60 ml (2 oz) of bleach to 4 l (1 gallon) of water. Clinical Manifestations Most cases have reportedly exhibited symptoms of fever, respiratory compromise, and bilateral pneumonia with diffuse, ground glass-like infiltrates on chest x-ray or CT scan. Unlike SARS-CoV, upper respiratory illness symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat) and diarrhea are not common. Overall, about 20% of the cases have been severe or critical, including pneumonia , respiratory failure, and in some cases death. The existence of asymptomatic cases has not been ascertained. No known treatment exists for 2019-nCoV, although remdesivir will be available shortly from the U.S. CDC for compassionate use. Usual antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir, ribavirin, and acyclovir, are ineffective. Steroids should not be used. Based on earlier literature , the combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir is under study in China. Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return. In a small cohort of 41 patients (median age was 49 years; interquartile range: 41-58) conducted early in the epidemic (presentation before January 2), the most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Dyspnea developed in 55% of patients at a median of 8 days. All cases except 1 had bilateral pneumonia. Milder cases had chest CTs that showed bilateral ground￾glass opacity with subsegmental areas of consolidation, whereas ICU patients had bilateral lobar and subsegmental areas of consolidation . Only 66% of cases (even in this early cohort) had been exposed to the South China Seafood City market. The case￾fatality rate was estimated to be 15%, but more severe cases tend to predominate early in an epidemic. Limited data from another published cluster study indicate a 3- to 6-day incubation period similar to SARS-CoV and clinical and radiologic features similar to SARS-CoV cases in 2003. Another report indicates an incubation period ranging from 1 to 14 days. Virology 2019-nCoV was initially isolated from 1 case and entirely sequenced; this information was published internationally by Chinese scientists on January 10. Electron microscopy of 1 specimen demonstrated classic coronavirus particles. 2019-nCoV is the seventh 

NIH-002138 member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Novel coronaviruses from Wuhan , together with 2 bat-derived SARS-like strains, form a distinct clade in lineage B of the subgenus sarbecovirus. 2019-nCov is a group 2b coronavirus (as are MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), with a whole genome similarity of up to 80% to SARS-CoV but with a similarity between different gene segments ranging from 60% to 90%. 2019-nCoV exhibits a 96.5% similarity to the known bat coronavirus precursors in the same viral clade. Sequence data allowed national laboratories to rapidly develop diagnostic kits, which are now available in most developed countries and most Asian countries. HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 are human coronaviruses that are detected by some routine multiplex PCR panels used in routine clinical practice. These coronaviruses are associated with minor upper respiratory infections and viral pneumonia, but unlike SARS-CoV , MERS￾CoV, and 2019-nCoV , these agents are not associated with major outbreaks or severe respiratory distress syndrome. 2019-nCoV is not reactive in these tests . The findings so far strongly favor (but do not prove) causation. 2019-nCoV has been shown to use the same cell-entry receptor as SARS-CoV. Viral loads appear to be highest in lower respiratory tract specimens, which should be the primary specimen obtained. Prediction of human-to -human transmissibility from sequence data is difficult because coronaviruses vary widely in their transmissibility; coronaviruses acquired from animals generally have some potential for human-to-human transmission. Evidence from subsequent whole genome sequences acquired over the last several weeks show little genetic variation, indicating that the virus jumped from an animal reservoir to humans within the last few months. Identical recent mutations in epidemiologically unlinked cases support sustained human-to-human transmission. Criteria for Testing of Suspected Cases U.S. CDC Persons meeting the following criteria (clinical features and epidemiologic risk) for suspected cases of 2019-nCoV will be considered persons under investigation (PUI): • Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) plus a history of travel to Wuhan or close contact with a PUI for 2019-nCoV while that person was ill in the past 14 days before symptom onset • Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) plus close contact with an ill, laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV case in the past 14 days before symptom onset HCWs entering the room with a PUI should use standard precautions, contact precautions , airborne precautions , and eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). PUis for 2019-nCoV should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne￾infection isolation room if available. Prevention Travelers going to Wuhan should avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat), and contact with ill￾appearing persons. Quality of infection control at medical facilities in Wuhan is uncertain, and those with minor medical problems should avoid busy medical settings. 

NIH-002139 Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in central China; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain. Travelers who develop fever and respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to Wuhan should immediately be isolated, and public health authorities should be alerted. Employees, Students , Visitors , All Others Coming from Wuhan Whether asymptomatic individuals infected with 2019-nCoV are infectious to others is unknown. Influenza viruses can be transmitted 1 to 2 days prior to symptom onset. SARS-CoV did not transmit until 4 days after symptom onset, which led to its eradication because all contacts with fever could be promptly identified and isolated. If 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS-CoV , asymptomatic arrivals from Wuhan should self￾monitor by taking a temperature reading immediately prior to coming into the workplace or school for 14 days after their last exposure in Wuhan. Arrivals with fever at any time should self-report to public health authorities (or telephone ahead before presenting to a hospital) and should wear a mask as soon as possible. A more stringent approach would require that an employee, student, or visitor-upon arrival to a workplace or school- be instructed to perform an additional temperature check in the presence of medical personnel to ensure compliance with local self-monitoring requirements. In addition, prior to any gathering of~ 2 persons, attendees could be required to perform additional self-monitoring . Based on advanced information and employee or visitor medical screening, additional preventive measures may be required (e.g., increased ventilation, larger meeting rooms with more personal space per participant , disinfection of work areas and lavatories, and provision of alcohol wipes). The most cautious approach would be for arrivals to stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible exposure in China. To date, all known cases exported to other countries had either visited Wuhan or had contact with an ill person from Wuhan while in China. Sent from my magical iPad!

I know that I am writing to you at a busy time during yet another infectious disease outbreak that is rapidly evolving . However, I wanted to send you a brief note to update you about the transformational change going on in the landscape of our free standing institute with its new, sharply defined goal to be the global leader in eradicating infectious disease threats in the world . I know that you are familiar with us. I have been leading the institute since June of 2017 and currently finishing year one of a 10 year board-approved plan of growth in our scientists , educationa l programming and campus modernization. I believe that you are aware that we house the only private BSL4 . We also just opened our newest of 5 BSL3 facilities , this newest one being nearly 8000 sq. ft. with capacity for ~100 NHPs , small animals, a complete aerosol suite and a PET CT. We also house the SNPRC, now under the leadership of Deepak Kaushal (who replaced Robert Lanford) and with the largest marmoset colony as a result of restructuring our building facilities (in addition to our other species . CbH4J Please check out our newly designed website: www .txbiomed.org. The bottom line is that I left university life to lead an organization that is determined to not only discover critical, new fundamental science but also effectively and efficiently bring it full forward to create portfolios for the FDA through our business model, nimbleness, regulated scienc e culture (GLP level), longstanding public and private partners through contract science ( esp. BARDA), culture and community support . NIH-002143 

We want to help! Please let us know if and how we can contribute to this outbreak and undoubtedly others going forward . I truly appreciate your leadership. The country gets the voice of reason on infectious disease outbreaks through your public efforts. I enjoyed learning more about this during my time on council.

Lacking the correct receptor or blocking binding of the virus spike protein to the receptor with monoclonal antibodies blocked infection . On to the present problem of human coronaviruses . Vaccines will take a long time for the current crisis. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor has been identified as the relevant human coronavirus receptor in earlier studies ofSARS and MERS human corona virns outbreaks. I am writing to suggest the investigat ion of ARBs as potential blocking agents to eithe r reduce or completely block infection . Perhap s this can be checked . if correct , there may still be sufficient untainted supplies of ARBs, such as irbesartan, available, or production can be scaled up, if this truly is the eve of a pandemic. Wishing you success in this endeavor. I am willing to contribute in any way l can. Please feel free to contact me by e-mail or my cell phone. T also did do clinical trials whil e with Mike, and then when I joined the neurology faculty of Jefferson in Phi ladelphia. I have been out on my own since Decemb er 1998, but I have never lost my interest in this work. For another time, I also have so me novel ideas on how HIV become s AIDS, as well.

The Report was prepared by CDC's best Ph.D.s, M.D.s, and D.V.M.s See the pdf attached above for the complete report. Below I have recorded what I think the most important facts in the report for Secretary Azar and other federal officials who must stop the spread of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. by identifying all infected persons and their contacts . I have also added my personal thoughts on how to stop t he spread of this novel coronavirus and a persona l fear I have communicated to Secretary Azar in the past: -- President Trump signed an order preventing entry into the U.S. of any person who has trave led to mai nland China (PRC). Exceptions in clude U.S. citizens and permanent residents and t heir famil ies. Thank you Mr. Trump. -- CDC maintains an office in the PRC. So info rmat ion from Wuhan, Hubei, PRC, shou ld be 'r eal time'. -- Enhanced screening of persons entering the U.S. is taking place at 18 ports and 5 airport s. The number of ports and especia lly airports needs to be increased. The Report states that 14,000 Chinese enter the U .S. daily. If the 5 airports receive 85% of these Chinese, then 2,1 00 Chinese enter the U.S. daily at other airports without enhanced screening. -- CDC has developed its own RT-PCR test to detect 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens. I have read case reports where state laboratories have required too much proof of suspected Wuhan virus from clinicians before perfo rming RT-PCR testing of specimens. CDC should provide their improved RT-PCR test to all states and HHS should insure that all states have sufficient equipment and trained personnel for rapid turn-around time. NIH-002152 

NIH-002153 -- CDC has grown the 2019-nCoV virus. CDC should expedite distribution of the grown virus to researchers with verified credentials and vetting in a safe and monitored procedure. -- CDC recommends that persons suspected by clinicians of having 2019-nCoV be placed in a separate room with a N95 face mask so that they are not in range of other patients. HCW should wear personal protection: gloves, gown, face shield or N95 mask and goggles. -- Clinicians have identified 8 of the current 11 patients infected with 2019-nCoV in the U.S. CDC is doing a terrific job in getting the message out to clinicians and the public.

I am now writing a piece regarding the treatment of people in isolation or quarantine over coronavirus in different countries . Most of the countries told the public where the people evacuated from Wuhan reside for quara ntine and some drew local's protests . They expressed concern over close vicin ity and some even went to protest in these places. Others like Taiwan, the authority decided to keep the quarantine location confidential. The reason is to avoid unnecessary worr isome and let people rest wel l. I would like to have an interview with you by e-mail or Skype phone with you to give some insights or comments on this issue. If you could be quoted, the questions are as below 1. Why does the government tell the public the quarantine location? Is it necessary? Or why not? NIH-002171 

NIH-002172 2. Many residents protested because they don't want the quarantine Center for Coronavirus in their neighborhood . Do they need to worry about it? 3. What is your suggestion regarding th e location of quarantine those people from Wuhan. And wh at is essenti al for Quarantin e Center for Coronaviru s? Thank you very much for your time .

I understand from various communications with the MHLW that is considering ending the quarantine early and releasing passengers from the Diamond Princess, especially those who are 80 years of age or older. Given the media reports and public perception there is pressure to do th is. However, as medical experts, you and I both know that days 3 - 8 are within the norma l incubation period and these new positives do not likely represent shipboard transmission. As such, HHS is willing to coordinate U.S. medical experts who can engage with English language media explaining and reassuring the passengers, crew, and public. Regarding support for the quarant ine, ASPR is ready to deploy a team of 3-5 people quickly, and as many 12 people to Japan to support as suggested in the previous call. If we can assist you and your team in managing the Americans currently in quarantine please let me know. If there is other support do let me know and ASPR will work to assist. As we've talked for the past 18 months about such a scenario, this may not be the one we envisioned, but it is a perfect case as we can clearly ident ify the Americans, they are in a contained area. Our mutual efforts and planning have paid unexpected dividends. I am available to discuss via teleconference at your convenience. I am grateful fo r all MHLW has done to support this complicated response on top of your work supporting repatriation and domestic monitoring of your own citizens. We are grateful for Dr. Sugihara's herculean information sharing efforts and the rest of your MHLW team support during this event; it NIH-001971

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who made a trip to Beijing fo r talks with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers in late January, returned with an agreement on sending an international mission. But it has taken nearly two weeks to get the government 's green light on its composition, which was not announced, other than to say that WHO vetera n Dr. Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and emergencies expert, was heading it. "I've just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led #2019nCoV internationa l expert mission to #China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies," Tedros said in a tweet from Geneva. Dr. Sylvie Briand, who accompanied Tedros last month and stayed behind for talks with top Chinese health officials, told Reuters last week that they were discussing a list of experts with China. "Because it is a joint mission, they need to be on board, it's not just an international group going there. We have about 15 people," said Briand, director of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness at WHO. China raised the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic, as authorities made plans for millions of people returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year break . The virus , which has spread to two dozen countries, has killed some 2% of more than 37,550 cases wor ldwide, with 99 percent of infections in China, WHO figures show. The WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, epicentre of the virus that emerged in December in a seafood marke t. NIH-002017 

NIH-002018 Tedros said on Saturday that he hoped the team would include experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). "It has to be meaningful on the ground," Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law, said in an interview in Geneva this week. Gostin called for a "genuine partnership with transparent flows of information and accountability for the response", adding that there should be a strong CDC presence. "CDC has got no peer in terms of its experience and technical expertise in dealing with international outbreaks," he said. "But the other benefit is the smart diplomacy, what it could signal is that despite all of our differences in ideology, trade , politics, that when faced with a common threat to humanity, we come together as a human community to tackle it," Gostin said.

I'm working on a news story tied to the coronavirus outbreak and tying it to how people responded to a recent global lpsos poll about the threat of a major health epidemic in their country in the next 12 months . https ://www .ipsos.com/sites/defau lt/files/ct/news/documents/20 19- 11/ a-more-dangerous-world -fear-2019.pdf I was hoping to get your comments on this, considering your expertise in infectious disease control. Below are some questions. If you could respond via email, that would be great as I am on a tight deadline to get this story up. If it's easier to give you a call, I can do that as well. Please let me know what works best. The story will be published on lpsos.com, on social media and our various country websites. Thank you and I look forward to your response. 1. In our survey of more than 18,500 people in 28 countries done in late last summer, more than half (51%) of people said there was threat of a major health epidemic in their country in the next 12 months w ith people in emerging markets at the top of the list. Are you surprised by this result? It's among the highest reading for this questio n since the Ebola outbreak in 2014 when the percentage climbed to 59%. 2. The U.S. is the only developed country in the top 10 list where most people think a major health epidemic will occur. Why do you think this is? 3. A follow up question to the previous one is how confident people are that their government could protect them or respond effectively if such an outbreak was to occur. Over half globally said they were confident in their gov't's response. Do you think people have a lot of trust in those in power to do the right thing in times of an outbreak? 4. Seven of the top 10 countries where people had the most confidence in govts are in the developed world . How important are developed healthcare systems when it comes to outbreaks like the coronavirus? 5. Likewise, many countries at the bottom of this list are emerging markets. What can govts in these countries do to ease peoples' fears on how they are or will handle an outbreak like the coronavirus? NIH-002193 

6. How difficult is it for governments and health officials to prevent the spreading of a virus like this before it becomes a pandemic? What measures can be taken? Please free to add any add itional information that you thin k may be relevant . I hope to hear from you soon.

The novel coronavirus outbreak will likely become a pandemic. We know the virus is very transmissible. The infection continues to accelerate and there is efficient transmission in china. If sustained transm ission also occurs in other countries throughout the world, the outbreak would fulfill the definitive of a pandemic -- Pandemic does not necessarily equate to a terrible situation, compared to, say bad flu seasons. What 's your expectation on the potential severity of this coronavirus? It is difficult to pred ict the severity at this time. Even if the morta lity rate of a virus remains low, if it is easily transmissible, the global impact can be significant . -- And your suggestion to people in the U.S. who might be very concerned? NIH-002195 

We are treating t he emergence of a novel coronavirus as a very serious public health threat. However, the risk to the general American publ ic remains low at this time . We understand that people may be wor ried . We ask that people not let fear or panic guide the ir actions . Thanks for any help you can provide.

I am a musician. I am 65 years old and live in Los Angeles. A news article published on rt.com Feb 31, 2020 (see link below) announced the Chinese have developed a 15 minute test for the Corona virus, yet I've not seen or heard about this news anywhere else. [ bad heard there were efforts here to develp a faster test than what is being employed currently by the CDC, but believe its critical the NIH-002197 

NIH-002198 White House arrange for the new Chinese test to be available in the US everywhere immediately. This news should have been mentioned by NIH doctor Anthony Fauc hi at the White House Briefing on Jan 31, 2020 but was not, nor was it mentioned by Mayor Di Blasio on Feb 1 at Bellevue Hospital in NY . At this point, the NTH, CDC and White Hous e shou ld have already obtained the Chinese 15 minute test for the virus and implement at all US medical centers and airports receiving travele rs from the infectious regions. Due to the exponential growth of infection rates from 'seed' individuals who are asymptomatic but don't know they are infectious, whether returni ng from infection zones or are infected by others already here, I am hoping you and other infectious disease experts waste no time in vigorously pursuading the White House , NTH, CDC and all other agencies as to the necessity to test ALL travelers (not just those who are symp tomatic) coming into the country by air and sea with the Chinese 15 minute test as well as pull out all the stops to develop an eve n quicker test that's portable. As the numbers of infections increases exponentially in the US and other countries this next 2 to 4 weeks from increasing numbers of asymptomatic 'seed' individuals unknowingly spreading the disease , we are certainly on the precipice of an unstopable runaway epidemic. What is also desperately needed from the federal government are frank and honest recommendations regarding what is necessary to prevent becoming infected such as: surgical or constmction respirators that seal to the face, eye protection goggles, nitrile exam gloves, sanitizer wipes along with specific protocols on how not to bring the vims particles back to ones car, borne and possessions. It is imperative that manufacturing of EFFECTIVE respirator masks or equivalent non-disposable respirators be ramped up to huge scale. Without adequate numbers of these , exam gloves and eye protection this country will not be capable of containing this epidemic . Below this article, I've pasted in a number of useful you tube links of relevant and timely information in reference. Thank you very much for your attention to this issue.

Experts from a tech company based in Wuxi in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, working with the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention , developed the rapid nucleic test kit in ju st ten days, according to the Xinhua news agency. The test takes between eight and 15 minutes to produce a result and is currently being mass-manufactured at a rate of 4,000 kits per day, with the city government in Wuxi explo ring efforts to boost production even further. The first batch of kits has reportedly already been deployed to the frontlines at the epicen tre of the outbreak, Wuhan , in Hubei province. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg33oZd0- R4 'We're basically at a pandemic now': Mayo Clinic physician on coronavirus 114,173 views

The typ ical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material. It might, however, provide some slight benefit in keep out gross droplets if someone coughs or sneezes on you.

Studies published in recent days say the new virus appears to be more contagious than seasonal flu and on par with the simi lar pathogen behind an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 and 2003. The new virus' mortality rate, however, is far below that of SARS. China says that as of Sunday there were 5,142 infected people in Wuhan, the locked-down city where the outbreak began. Some scientists estimate based on statistical models that the number could be in the tens of thousands. As health autho rities race to control the outbreak, they are also scrambling to figure out. based on imperfect data, how the virus is transmitted, the length of the incubation period and the degree to which people w ithout symptoms can spread the disease. China's health commission says incubation is generally between three and seven days, with the longest period being 14 days, and that people can spread the virus before appearing ill. That makes a two-week NIH-002208 

NIH-002209 quarantine an important prevention measure-and casts doubt on the efficacy of temperature checks, the main screening method at immigration and other checkpoints. "For a given level of transmissibility, more asymptomatic transmission makes a disease harder to control," said Christi A. Donnelly, a professor at University of Oxford and Imperial College London. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which warns against nonessential trave l to China, says it isn't clear how easily or sustainably the virus is spreading between people, but notes its abil ity to spread from infected patients without symptoms to close contacts within about 6 feet. A study led by a researcher from Boston's Northeastern University-using mathematical probability models based on travel patterns and confirmed international cases-estimated the median number of infections in Wuhan at 31,200 as of Wednesday, compared with that day's official tally of 2,261. Professors at the University of Hong Kong using similar methods published a study in the Lancet on Friday that estimated there were 75,815 infected in Wuhan as of Jan. 25, when official counts were still in the hundreds. "We think only 1 in 20 people who are getting infected are actually being diagnosed" in Wuhan, said Jonathan M. Read, lead author of a study from Britain's Lancaster University that also put Wuhan numbers in the tens of thousands as of Jan. 22. "It's quite a bit more transmissible than seasonal flu." Several recent studies published by scientists estimate that each person infected will, on average, infect two to three others. Epidemiologists call that the reproduction number . A reproduction number over 2 suggests an epidemic will expand rapidly, while below 1 suggests the problem is dwindling. Estimates of the reproduction number differ widely, with some studies using probability models and others based on regression analysis of cases over different time periods . Still, "they all point in the same direction," said Christian L. Althaus, an epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland who co-wrote a study estimating the basic reproduction number of the virus at 2.2. "There is a potential threat of a global pandemic if this reproduction number cannot be reduced." In Japan, a local bus driver in his 60s tested positive after he drove tourists from Wuhan, none of whom had exhibited severe symptoms . In Germany, four employees at an auto-parts supplier contracted the virus after attending a training session with a colleague from China, according to the company . The Chinese woman didn't exhibit symptoms, but started feeling ill on her flight home, where she tested positive for the new coronavirus. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine study by Chinese authors including at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention says the virus spread between people as early as mid-December. The researchers analyzed 425 patients, with more than half of the cases linked to the Hua nan seafood wholesale market where authorities believe the virus first spread to humans from wild animals. The researchers started identifying and collecting cases around the start of the year, by interviewing patients, relatives and other close contacts. They estimated the reproduction number at 2.2 and said that the majority of patients weren't hospitalized unti l after five days of being ill. Researchers of recent studies cautioned that even their estimates of the virus' reproduction number are based on early and incomplete data and only assess its potential to spread before trave l restrictions and other control measures begin. Thereafter, the reproduction number can vary depending on those measures' effectiveness and other circumstances of the outbreak. Chinese officials have said the outbreak could peak or even begin to subside by Feb. 8, though some overseas experts have suggested the outbreak might not peak for several weeks. They note that the reproduction number doesn't necessarily predict an outbreak 's severity, as many other factors come into play. Measles, for example, has a reproduction number of 12 to 18, but doesn't spread that fast because there is a widely used vaccine. As yet, there are no vaccines for the new coronavirus, so Chinese authorities are relying on physical intervention measures, including locking down entire cities and forced quarantine . 

NIH-002210 Recent studies indicate that stringent control measures will be needed not just in China, but in several other countries, to curtail the outbreak . "This is unprecedented both in terms of the virus and the control measures that have been put in place," says Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. - Raffaele Huang, Miho lnada and Ruth Bender contributed to this article.

I focused on genetic resistance, and eventually described a mouse locus for susceptibi lity, which coded for the MHV receptor. On to the present problem of human coronaviruses, Vaccines will take a long time for the current crisis. The angiotens in convertin enzyme 2 receptor has been ident ifed as the relevant human coronavirus receptor. I am writing to suggest the investigation of ARBs as potential blocking agents to either reduce or completely block infection. Perhaps this can be checked. There may sti ll be sufficient untai nted suppl ies of ARBs, such as irbesartan, available , or production can be scaled up, if this truly is the eve of a pandemic .

The Watchdogs Quick retraction of a faulty coronavirus paper was a good moment for science By Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus February 3, 2020 NIH-002237 

- -- ----• ,Hyacinth Empinado/STAT As fears of the novel coronav irus 2019-nCoV continued to spread last Friday, an inflammatory new paper appeared on bioRxiv, a preprin t server, where scientists post work that hasn't been vetted. Titled "Uncanny similarity of unique insert s in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag," the paper claimed to find similarities between the new coronavirus and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The use of the word "uncanny" in the title, together with "unlikely to be fortuitous" in t he abstract, led some to th ink that the authors were suggesting the virus had somehow been engineered by humans. The paper, from academic institutions in New Delhi, India, was critical and alarming, if true. Except that it wasn't. The paper was almost immediately withdrawn, but not before plenty of handwringing from researchers who complained that the appearance of such shoddy work on a preprint server without vetting by peer reviewers is precisely why the hoary old model of science publishing is better at keeping junk science out of the literature. Except that's not true, eit her. The old model has its advantages, to be sure, but it, too, is prone to the menace of pseudoscience, bad data, and other flaws - despite traditional academic journals' army of peer reviewers. And when these publications publish bad or erroneous research, it can take months or years for the papers to be corrected or retracted - if they ever are. In contrast, the reaction from the scientific community to the bioRxiv paper was swift. In a nutshell, commenters on bioRxiv and Twitter said, the author's methods seemed rushed, and the findings were at most a coincidence. By Saturday morning, bioRxiv had placed a special warning on all papers about coronavirus. Later Saturday, the authors commented on their paper, saying they were w ithdrawing it . And on Sunday, a more forma l ret raction appeared: "This paper has been withdrawn by its authors . They intend to revise it in response to comments received from the research community on their technical approach and their interpre tation of the results." All of that happened before a single news outlet with any reach covered the paper, as best we can tell. But none of it was quite fast enough for some critics. "This is why preprints can be bad," said one scient ist on Twitte r. That scientist, Michael Shiloh, said he had even used bioRxiv to post preprints. "What bugs me about this preprint is that had this manuscript undergone legitimate peer review, these flaws would have led to a swift rejection and it wouldn't be contributing to the conspiracy theories and fear surrounding this outbreak," Shiloh cont inued. History suggests that Shiloh's confidence in peer review's ability to suss out pseudoscience may be a bit misplaced . The fraudulent 1998 paper that set off the vaccine-autism scare was published in The Lancet, one of the world's leading peer-reviewed medical journals. Other examples - including a paper by an NIH-002238 

NIH-002239 intelligent design advocate questioning the validity of the second law of thermodynamics as it pertained to evolution - abound . Papers claiming a link between autism and vaccines pop up nearly every year. Preprints can fill a void in times of rapidly changing science And even when peer-reviewed jou rnals do realize they've been had, retractions can take months or years. The Lancet took 12 years. Another journa l took five years to retract a paper claiming that HIV did not cause AIDS. We could go on, and the list includes papers that have never even been corrected. Those who claim preprint servers are dangerous because they lack peer review - bioRxiv has a perfunctory screening process - sometimes acknowledge that journals have had to speed up their game to meet the pressures of an outbreak like coronavirus, or SARS in the early part of this century. Angela Cochran, president of the Society for Scholarly Publishing, a trade group for publishers, said on Twitter : "Earlier this week, folks celebrated that coronavirus papers were popping up in preprint servers. Now there is a reminder not to use them to guide clinical practice because they haven't been reviewed. Journals ARE reviewing coronavirus papers and getting [them] pub'd quickly." Kent Anderson, another publishing industry veteran, put it more bluntly: "Journals Win The Coronavirus Race." Publishers have been looking for ways to score points against - and shut down - preprints for at least half a century . Journals have speedily published a number of important papers on the new coronavirus already, no doubt. Publishing industry champions are often quick to say that speedy peer review does not mean sloppy peer review - even in cases that require massive correct ions. It now turns out that one of the world's leading peer-reviewed medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine, published a lette r last week about apparent coronavirus transmission from an asymptomatic person that turns out to be wrong . Such letters to the editor are not typically peer￾reviewed, or at least not as rigorously as a full study. But it's a glaring example of how a peer-reviewed journal can end up getting things wrong. Now we get to wait and see how long it takes NEJM to correct the record. We'll see whether peer-review champions, who are often unwilling - with some notab le and welcome exceptions - to acknowledge how slow and ineffective correction in science can be, note this apparent failure of one of their gatekeepers. Doing so might, after all, make some people question the expensive subscription deals universities agree to w ith publ ishers, as well as the article processing charges that can run into the thousands of dollars for open access publications. Peer review can add a valuable filter. But those who work in publishing seem to be so wedded to the existing process that they can't admit its fl aws - or that it might be a good idea to also embrace preprint servers that could upend their business models. Just like in politics, maybe it's time to agree that the publishing process is a messy one, and stop using single episodes, free of context, to score points against one's rivals.

Dear Dr. Fauci, As you reali zed the Indian resea rche r published a paper few days ago entitled "Uncann y similarjty of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike prote in to HIV-I. gp120 and Gag", which was latterly withdrawn due to the controversial indication. I did a quick SWISS-MODEL online calcu lation. Page 1-3 of the attachm ent show the flexible loops of insertion "1 ", "2", and "3" originally from V4, V5 and Vl ofHIV-1 gp120, respectively. But they are in presence on the spike protein of both bat and 20 19 corona virus (page 4 and 6). These insertions are potential CD4 binding domains (no proof yet but highly likely) and spatially won't interfere with ACE-2 binding domain (both SARS and 2019 coronavirus targetACE-2, page 5 and 6). In another word, the 2019 virus could be poten tially dual-targeting, infecting the lung and potentially CD4 T cells too (like HIV, see page 6) ! It is VERY URGENT to have clinicians follow up the confirmed cases such as by isolating their CD4 cells and doing RT-PCR. Please reach out to them. Rese arch labs including mine after obta ining Spike protein of 20 19-nCoV shall examine its interaction with CD4. NIH-002252

It is unfortunate that they did not interview the patient. Obviously, this changes the conclusion of the paper. My comment: "There1 s no doubt after reading [the NEJM] paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurr ing" was made because there has been a lot of discussion among Chinese investigators that asymptomatic infection is occurring in Wuhan City and Hubei Province, yet no publication came out and said this. Since th is was the first publication supposedly documenting this phenomenon, that is why I referred to the paper and made my comment. It is unfortunate that this error was published, but it still does not really change anything. Rather than rely on rumors, this evening I telephoned one of my colleagues in China who is a highly respected infectious diseases scientist and health official. He said that he is convinced that there is asymptomatic infection and that some asymptomatic people are transmitting infection . The NEJM paper may be incorrect, but according to reputable Chinese scientists , my statement is correct . Having said that, I have been saying for some time that even if asymptomatic infection occurs, it is very unlikely to be a major driver of the outbreak since most transmissions occur from someo ne who is asymptomatic.

Remember that for t he SARS outbreak in 2002, bats infected palm civet cats who were sold in live/wet markets and the civet cats spread the virus to human . Same for MERS - bats to camels to humans. You ask that there have been animal markets for a long time, and so why now. The fact is that this is likely pure chance+/- more interactions in the human-animal interface . Animal viruses mutate and most of the time the mutations have no significant impact on virus transmission to humans . Sometimes they mutate and allow single "dead end" transmissions to individual humans with no efficiency in going human to human and so we get individual infections and no outbreak as we have seen with HSNl and H7N9 influenzas that jump from chickens to humans but do not go from human to human. And then rarely, animal viruses mutate and the mutat ion allows them not only to jump species to humans, but to also efficiently spread from human to human . That is what we saw in SARS and now we see this with 2019-nCoV, which seems to have adapted itself very well to human to human transmission, as per what is happening in China. I hope that this is helpful. Best regards, Tony Anthony S.

The has nothing to do with the validity of the test. We see this w ith other viruses when you look at shedding. When there is a low titer of virus, any specific site (in this case a nose or throat swab) may vary between positive and negative even though the person is clearly still infected . It could be that the virus is there in the throat at one point and cleared at another and comes back again. Alternatively, it may be that the virus is always there, but at different titers and at some points it is present below the sensitivity of the test, even though the test is in general quite sensitive. Hope that this is helpful. Best regards, Tony Anthony S.

H·1 I. I read that you are an expert working for NIAID and that you got interviewed about treatments for the corona viru s. I am a Swedish physician specialized in clinical chemistry. (b)(6) and wanted to share a hypothesis I have. I believe that some patients who are seriously ill in corona virus {or flue/SARS) with lung symptoms have a lack of normal/well functioning Alpha-1-antitrypsin for example PiZZ. Alpha￾1 anti trypsin is an acute phase reactant and increases in sick people. I have seen that the Alpha-1- antitrypsin level can be elevated in a severely ill person (HlNl) if measured in a laboratory, even thought the patient was homozygous for mutations in the Alpha-1-a ntit rypsin gene. An elevated level of Alpha-1 antitrypsin is misleading and can result in the physician believing that there is nothing wrong with the patients function of Alpha-1-antitrypsin. I also guess that critically ill ECMO-treated patients with lung symptoms might benefit from receiving Alpha-1 anti protease inhibitor in addition to other medications given to them. What do you think? I believe that this information can contribute in understanding why some supposedly healthy individuals gets really sick and even die in corona virus, flue/HlNl or SARS.

Over the past 48 hours, PrEP4AII has received multiple requests from leaders of public health departments and public health practitioners to begin publicly pressuring CDC/HHS to ensure that properly equipped publ ic health labs (besides CDC's lab in Atlanta) can perform real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) testing for 2019 Novel-Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Our understanding is that given the public health emergency declared by HHS, an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA is required for public health labs to perform their own lab developed test for 2019-nCoV, even if it is using the CDC's published qRT-PCR protocol and primer/probe sequences ( htt ps://www .cdc .gov/ coronav i rus/2 019-ncov /down loads/ rt-pcr-pane l-fo r-detect ion- i nstr uctions . pdf ) , and the lab is capable of handling BSL3+ samples. We understand the extreme delicateness of this situa t ion, and also that it is outside of our normal wheelhouse . But given the concerns of our colleagues in the public health sector, we thought it was important to give you a heads up regarding this request . Let us know if there is anyway we can help .

Dear Dr. Fauci, I am a mere clinician . But I have published repeatedly on a therapy which, I believe, will remedy patients with coronavirus and spare a possible catastrophe, if the virus is as lethal as it appears. The therapy is ozone. It can be performed, depending on the method, for mere pennies in mater ials. It is not patentable, so, it lacks profitability needed for some payback for the basic research to get it "approved" . It attacks a key vulnerabi lity on this virus and even Ebola. We got to 5 Ebola cases in Sierra Leone. All 5 recovered almost immed iately. No sequela. No one has repo rted anyth ing like that. I have used ozone therapy for 33 years, ;longer than anyone in North America . It absolutely changed my practice. I write essentially no prescriptions for antib iotics, including for Lyme disease. This therapy, I recently published, might be the solution the world desperately needs for the emerging crisis in resistant infections. I am attaching 2 papers I recently published on ozone therapy, And a manuscript we just got done to address corona virus, wh ich I am try ing to get published. It is not easy. The medical world is vested in Pharmaceuticals. I urge you to please look at this. Not patentable, it will never be a darling of industry. But just for that reason (dirt cheap), it could be a savior for thousands or more who might die from a pandemic. I am coming to you about this as one physicist came to President Roosevelt about harnessing the power of the atom at the dawn of world war 2. I do hope you will take note of what I am forwarding to you. The first file is a word document I am seeking to get published. Usually, an author will hold up on making material like this public until he get published. However, wi th lives immediately on the line, we want to alert people that the does exist an available very inexpensive and extremely safe medical treatment for this and other infections .

Fauci, you might not remember me from my previous email. I'm a Brazilian who asked you some months ago about the influenza virus differences across regions. I recently traveled to DC and NY and had a great time there (before the Corona Virus outbreak) I have some specific questions about the new Corona Virus, and would be very grateful if you can answer them : 1- Using available data, I've made a simple spreadsheet attempting to pred ict the virus behavior : https://do cs.google .com/spre adsheets/d/1DAHQt FzXO￾FKU405k8p864JBVHAlfzsHQghuywaTNbE/ed it#gid=O I've used exponential tr end, although it seems to be spreading slower than the expected, I'd like to know if there's an accurate model for pred icting th is virus. Also, I assume virus don't always spread exponentially? 2- I listened to your interview podcast https ://edhub .ama-assn.org/j n-learning/aud io-player/18197306 . Really amazing content. Let's assume this is going to be a wor ldwide outbreak. How can I get prepared for the worst? Buy water, dry food , stay indoors, w ithdraw money, etc? Once again, I'd like to thank you very much for reading this emai l. I bet t his is a very busy time for you, so it means a lot to me Thank you, Rafael NIH-002305

The expected outcome is a research roadmap with clearly defined priorit ies and a governance framework to take each thematic area forward . Several thematic areas will be considered at the meeting, namely: virus, diagnostics; natural history and transmission; clinical; therapeutics; vaccines; ethics; regulatory science; animal health; data/samples analysis and sharing and; social sciences. We believe that this meeting will be critical in consensus building on the most important research questions, as well as in building global partnerships and collaborations to take this work forward. This meeting is being organized in partnership with GLOPID Rand is being supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, DFID, Wellcome Trust and several other partners. The secretariat within WHO is the R&D blueprint, co-chaired by Dr Mike Ryan and myself. As the head of an agency that would play an important role in addressing this new viral outbreak, either by undertaking or funding research, or both, I take great pleasure in inviting you to this meeting. I apologize for the short notice, but you will understand that we have had to plan this in the past few days, keeping in mind the evolving situation. Kindly let me know if you (or your nominee) will be able to attend and if you need any support from us. Please copy (bH and (b)(6) in your response.

Does it make sense to talk about RO at this stage? 3 You had talked about asymptomatic patients, and how public health workers should treat asymptomatic people?

Wuhan. The reason is that, firstly, there is no commercial interest to pharmaceutical manufacturers, and secondly, such outbreaks may not return after the extinction. What do you think of these views? 2 For the Wuhan virus vaccine being developed, the epidemic is likely to be elimina ted after three months, so is it still necessary to develop a vaccine? 3 You can talk about SARS.

I amEj years old. I live in (b)(6) Ecuador South America. Here in Ecuador in 1999 in shrimp farms in Ecuador there was a lethal disease among shrim p called the white spot virus syndrome . He appeared in 1999 in Ecuador and made shrimp sick and eliminated them. In China it appeared in 1993. White spot virus syndrome is caused by a virus from the nimavir idae family that infects a vi bran parahaemolitycus . I applied more than 10 billion liters of natural and organic biological molecules of my invention for 10 years from 2002 to 2011 in more than 10 thousand hectares of shrimp farms. These molecules have antiviral characteristics and inhibit the glycoproteins of viruses. These glycoproteins are what open cell receptors to infect and replicate. Also these natural molecules invented in (b)(6) Ecuador in 2001 inhibit the cytokinins that inflame hepatopancreas. Cytokinins cause the desquamation of epithelial cells from tubules that end up collapsing to the liver and shrimp pancreas. These viruses infect the parahaernolitycus vibrating bacteria and create an incurable syndrome in the shrimp. In 2002 we defeated this disease and contro lled it ... with this Ecuador to produce little shrimp, now in 2019 it is the number one in the world to export shrimp. In the same way, the coronavirus 2019- nCoV Wuhan infects the pneumococci of the lung and the respiratory syndrome develops. Wuhan coronavirus is the seventh among the coronaviruses after sars and mers. Another 4 are simpler in animals that cause the flu. 2019-nCoV causes 2% of deaths. There are 250 dead as of January 31, 2020 and more than 10 thousand infected in China. 20 count ries have infections. It is tr ansmitted even without symptoms and its incubation is 2 to 14 days. We can spray with more than 1000 million liters of these virus inhibitory molecules throughout Wuhan . 1 million hectares (10,000 m2) can be fumigated by fumigation planes as they are made in banana plantations in Ecuador. We can inhibit all viruses with bacteria and biological molecules to inhibit viruses. And we can give them more than 100 million liters to take for more than 100 million liters for humans to more than 100 million inhabitants of the entire province of Hubei in China, so that they do not transm it coronaviruses ... and the seriously ill can also heal They are natural antibacterial, anviral and antifungal biological molecules ... they are immune regenerati ng cell bioimmunmodulato rs and immune boosting immune response in immunocompromised people who have diabetes and high blood pressure. Others may have cytokinin and immunoglobulin problems . We can finish with the 2019-nCoV Wuhan in the environment and in humans so be found in the lungs whose epithelial cells are already collapsing with an increase in inflammation and difficulty breathing . We can beat the coronav iruses NIH-002366

Thought you might find this interesting, if you have time to breat he let alone read media reports! All the best and hope to see you at the end of next month . Jason Coronav irus Lurking in Feces May Reveal Hidden Risk of Spread 2020-02-01 06:55 :00.469 GMT By Jason Gale (Bloomberg) -- While doctors have focused on respiratory samples from pneumonia cases to identify coronavirus patients, they might have ignored a less apparent and hidden source of the spread: diarrhea . The novel coronavirus was detected in the loose stool of the first U.S. case -- a finding that hasn't featured among case reports from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. However, that doesn't surprise scientists who have studied coronaviruses , nor doctors familiar wit h the bug that caused SARS. Diarrhea occurred in about 10-20% of patients afflicted with severe acute respiratory syndrome about 17 years ago and was the source of an explosive SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens residential complex in Hong Kong. SARS and Wuhan viruses bind to the same distinctly shaped protein receptors in the body that are expressed in the lungs and intestines, making these organs the primary targets for both viruses, said Fang Li, an associate professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at the University of Minnesota. The discovery of the Wuhan virus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, in the fecal material of the 35-year-old man treated at the Providence NIH-002370 

NIH-002371 Regional Medical Center Everett in Washington is "interesting," said Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for infectious disease at Washington's Department of Health. "That adds to the knowledge about this,'1 he told reporters on a conference call Friday. "It's not only excreted in your respiratory secretions, it's also secreted in your stool." Read More: What You Need to Know About the Spreading Coronavirus Researchers don't yet know how exactly 2019-nCoV spreads from person to person, but suspect it's most likely from coming into contact with virus-containing droplets that could be emitted by an infected person's cough and transferred to their hands or surfaces and objects. Face Masks That's led to a run on face masks. But those may be of limited benefit in the event the virus is being transmitted via the fecal-oral route, said John Nicholls, a clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong. Squat latrines, common in China, lacking covers and hands that aren't washed thoroughly with soap and water after visiting the bathroom could be a source of virus transmission, said Nicholls, who was part of the research team that isolated and characterized the SARS virus. A virus-laden aerosol plume emanating from a SARS patient with diarrhea was implicated in possibly hundreds of cases at Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003. That led the city's researchers to understand the importance of the virus's spread through the gastrointestinal tract, and to recognize both the limitation of face masks and importance of cleanliness and hygiene, Nicholls said in an interview. "I think in Wuhan, that would be a very likely place where you might get the transmission" from fecal material , he said. "If it's using the same receptor as for SARS, I can't see why it shouldn't be replicating in the gut." Nicholls and colleagues at the University of Hong Kong are testing laboratory models of human tissues and specimens to understand where and how the Wuhan virus replicates, he said. Emerging Evidence Doctors have reported diarrhea infrequently in 2019-nCoV patientsadmitted to Wuhan hospitals, though it's been more prominent among reported cases outside the city, including members of a Shenzhen family infected in Wuhan, and more recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state . That patient exper ienced a two -day bout of diarrhea from which a 

NIH-002372 sample tested positive. The lab in Washington didn't attempt to grow the virus from that specimen, said Lindquist, the state epidemiologist, "because it wasn't going to add anything to his care." Many of the emerging coronaviruses are so-called pneumoenteric viruses, meaning they can replicate both in the respiratory tract and the gastrointestinal system, said Ralph Barie, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has studied coronaviruses for decades. Overwhelmed by hundreds of severely sick pneumonia patients, doctors in Wuhan might not have focused on any gastric signs, Barie said in a phone interview. 'So Overwhelmed' "The Chinese are so overwhelmed at the moment and trying to do a combination of treating patients and dealing with t he scope of the outbreak, and then trying to get out papers that describe what's happening," he said. Any virus in stool is more likely to be present during the acute phase of an infection, occuring before hospitalized patients develop a life-threatening complication known as acute respiratory distress syndrome, Barie said. "I have also spent most of my time focusing on the respiratory tract symptomology rather than the gut because of the relationship between these different emerging viruses and acute respiratory distress syndrome," he said. Zijian Feng, deputy director general of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and colleagues released a report Wednesday on the first 425 Wuhan cases, and noted that early infections that didn't appear to display typical signs -- such as fever and viral pneumonia -- or had mild symptoms might have been missed. "The initial focus of case detection was on patients with pneumonia, but we now understand that some patients can present with gastrointestinal symptoms," Feng and co-authors said in their report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Emerging evidence of virus-containing diarrhea warrants further investigation, said Peter Collignon, a professor of clinical medicine at the Australian Nationa l University Medical School in Canberra, who advises the Australian government on infection control. "This is something new," Collignon said in an interview. "We presume it's respiratory droplets, but with SARS there was evidence of other routes . We have to keep an open mind."

We also have the executive conference room reserv ed from 1 :30 pm on. Please plan to arrive around then, so that you can talk with Senator Lieberman and the other speakers before the event starts at 2:00 pm. Just ask the receptionist to direct you where to go. Here are the speakers: • Forme r Senator Joe Lieberman , co-chair, Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense • Dr. Julie Gerberding, Executive Vice President & Chief Patient Officer, Strategic Communications, Global Public Policy and Population Health , Merck; former Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • Dr. Billy Karesh, ex officio , Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense ; Executive VP, EcoHealth Alliance • The Honorable Tim Morrison, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute ; former Deputy Assistant to President Trump for National Security; former Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Weapons of Mass Destruction and Biodefense • Mr. Eric Brown, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute NIH-002391 

NIH-002392 • Dr. Daniel S. Chertow (CAPT - US Public Health Service) , Head, Emerging Pathogens Section , Critical Care Medicine Department , Clinical Center & Laboratory of lmmunoregulation , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , National Institutes of Health (invited) The setting will be relatively informal. Scooter Libby will first introduce Senator Lieberman . Then Senator Lieberman will make a short opening statement, and look to Billy to set the stage and talk about the zoonotic nature of the disease , associated disease management considerations , etc., in about 5 minutes. The Senator will then ask each of the other speakers to say a few words from their perspectives . Afte r that, Senator Lieberman will ask some questions of the group, allowing you all to answer and converse. All of this should take about 45 minutes. Then we will allow the audience to ask questions . We are planning for Senator Lieberman to moderate the discussion and take questions from the audience , but if for some reason he cannot do so, then Billy Karesh will. I hope you will be able to make it, Dan. Let me know if you have any questions (and if you will be able to make it, of course) and I look forward to seeing you on February 10th. Asha Asha M.

Yes, I saw th is earlier today and both Eddie and myself are actually quoted in it . It's a great article, but the problem is that our phylogenetic analyses aren't able to answer whether the sequences are unusual at indivi dual residues, except if they are completely off. On a phylogenetic t ree the virus looks totally normal and the close clustering with bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir . The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered. We have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so w e should know much more at the end of the weekend . I should mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike, and myself all find the genome inconsistent wit h expectations from evolutionary theory . But we have to look at this much more closely and th ere are still further analyses to be done, so tho se opinions could still change.

As part of a long-running effort to see what viruses bats harbor, researchers in China collect one from a cave in Guandong. EcoHealth Alliance Mining coronavirus genomes for clues to the outbreak's origins By Jon CohenJan. 31, 2020, 6:20 PM attaaaggtt tataccttcc caggtaacaa accaaccaac tttcgatctc ttgtagatct ... That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhelming China and frightening the entire world. Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients-53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like. how it's changing, and how it might be st opped. "One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human -to -human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Hua nan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The vira l sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan. In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on viro logical.org, nextstrain.org , preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-rev iewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the wor ld to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.) NIH-002397 

When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-wh ich are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bioRxiv that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermediary" host species-or several-between bats and 2019-nCoV. According to Bedford 's analysis, the bat coronaviru s sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On next strain.org, a site he co￾founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The t rees are interactive-by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's easy to see the differences and similar ities between the sequences.) ~ -...... .... -.11 -,_ -·-- -.. ~ -- - 111(4::-1 -u ,_. , Ill ~ ..

So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, similarly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the phylogenetic tree from Shi's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see. NIH-002398

But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans . "There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species. Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spread ing 2019-nCoV, but w hether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain . Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases-27 of the fi rst 41 in one repor t, 26 of 47 in another -wer e connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not . This raises the possibi lity that the initial jump into people happened elsewhe re. NIH-002399 

According to Xinhua. the state-run news agency. "environmental sampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is whe re wildlife were sold. "The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus ." Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and determine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research. One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmitted the virus to different people at different markets. Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how man zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says. A research group sent fecal and other bodi ly samples from bats they trapped in caves to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to search for coronaviruses. EcoHealth All iance In the absence of clear conclusions about the outbreak's origin, theories thrive, and some have been scientifica lly shaky. A sequence analysis led by Wei Ji of Peking University and published on line by the Journal of Medical Virology received substantial press coverage when it suggested that "snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV." Sequence specialists, however. pilloried !!- Conspiracy theories also abound. A CBC News report about the Canadian government deporting Chinese scientists who worked in a Winnipeg lab that studies dangerous pathogens was distorted on social media to suggest that they were spies who had smuggled out coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, wh ich is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility. Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new blosafety level 4 lab and Included molecular biologist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened NIH-002400 

with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright quest ioned the accuracy of Bedford's calculation that there are at least 25 years of evolutionary distance between RaTG13- the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute - and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells Sciencelnsider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident." Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longtime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There's this incredible diversity of viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface. Within that diversity, there will be some that can infect people and within that group will be some that cause illness." A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Eco Health Alliance have trapped bat s in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses. EcoHealth All iance Daszak and Sh i's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of wh ich fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province . "We cannot assume that just because this virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered. "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we're going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV]." It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says. "If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak dies, there could be a cont inued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are." Posted in: • Asia/ Pacific NIH-002401

The FDA for years has mostly stayed out of the debate around drug prices I Jacquelyn Martin, File/ AP Photo By SARAH OWERMOHLE and SARAH KARLIN-SMITH 01/31/2020 04:54 PM EST Updated: 01/31/2020 05:28 PM EST New FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn faced a jam-packed agenda: opioids , CBD, vaping, and how to let states safely import drugs. Then the Wuhan coronavirus broke out. The virus was declared a public health emergency by HHS just a few hours after Hahn's exclusive interview with POLITICO Friday. That kicks the agency into overdrive in multiple roles - helping speed vaccine, drug and diagnostic test development while also trying to avoid shortages of drugs and devices the United States needs that are made in China. Advertisement Hahn said there have not been any reports yet of disruption of the supply chain or shortages, but the agency is looking ahead and planning for "what could potentially be the most serious of scenarios." As of now FDA inspections in China are being conducted on a case-by-case basis. NIH-002411 

NIH-002412 "We are taking on an individual -by-individual basis what's the regulatory need for anything in China ... versus what are the personnel risks associated," he said. Monitoring the the situation in China could soon get trickier as the State Department expands mandatory evacuation from affected areas of the country. The coronavirus also broke out in an election year when President Donald Trump wants to deliver on his promise to bring down drug prices - not traditionally the province of the FDA, a regulatory agency designed to focus on safety and efficacy . "If my patients couldn't get access to something because of cost - that was a real problem for me as a doctor . Now I'm on the other end of that, but what can we do to make sure that that pipeline flows in the best way possible?" said Hahn, 60, an oncolog ist, researcher and Washington newcomer. Hahn was confi rmed as commissioner on Dec. 18, the night before the administrat ion announced its plan to let states import cheaper medicines from Canada - an approach that prior FDA commissioners opposed over fears it would jeopardize the safety of the drug supply . Trump has endorsed letting states such as Florida do this.

POLITICO Pro OataP(llnl Patterson Clark/POLITICO Pro DataPoint "There is a compe lling reason that the American peop le want us to cons ider this and so we're go ing to have to figure th is one out and balance both of those issues," Hahn said, referring to safety and affordability. NIH-0024 13 

NIH-002414 The FDA for years has mostly stayed out of the debate around drug prices; the agency doesn't regulate the cost of medicines or health insurance coverage. But Hahn talked up FDA's role in getting prices down by approving more generics, acknowledging that "the American people are expecting us to do more." Trump has touted the FDA's record on boosting competition via generic approvals . As FDA works on finalizing the importation rule, Hahn said the agency will be open to addressing criticism that states can't save money bringing in drugs from Canada if the pathway is too burdensome. But he stressed safety is tantamount. "Our primary concern is the protection of the drug supply," he said. Hahn said he has also talked with CMS Administrator Seema Verma about addressing costs of new brand-name products that are approved with limited data sets, similar to the way CMS decides to cover some medical devices. That approach - known as coverage with evidence development - lets CMS cover a new prod uct on the condition that manufacturers keep providing data. FDA has not done that, but new medicines are increasingly being approved on smaller clinical trials without hard data on clinical benefits - and can come with six-figure price tags. As an academic, Hahn had co-written an editorial suggesting that payments for newly approved radiation oncology devices could be linked to older products unt il enough evidence builds up to show that the new products are superior. Only then would manufacturers have more pricing leeway . "It's a CMS call about coverage with evidence development, but I do think in this world where we are concerned, and rightfully so, about the cost of medicine and health et cetera, that we should be looking at all avenues to approach that, " he told POLITICO. Over the last few years, some critics have said the FDA is overcorrecting and moving too quickly to approve drugs without adequate evidence. But Hahn did not indicate he would put the brakes on. "At the end of the day there is this balance between the gold standard and being efficient and getting th ings in people's hands I'm totally confident in the agency's ability to do that." Hahn must balance all that while leading the FDA's response t o t he Wuhan crisis, which has heightened some lawmakers' concern about U.S. reliance on Chinese drug manufacturing after incidents of contamination with carcinogens. "We have to be concerned about the supply chain to make sure that we have enough of what we need if there are any potential outbreaks here," Rep. Susan Brooks (R-lnd .) said after a closed-door briefing Thursday for Energy and Commerce committee members with top health officials . The fact that China manufactures much of the protective medical gear used in U.S. hospitals and clinics "should cause us to be reexamining what we're doing in China versus what should be brought back to this country." she said. Outside of the coronavirus, a host of thorny regulatory issues await Hahn. Industry and lawmakers have pressed for a clear FDA framework on selling cannabidiol, the popular hemp and marijuana byproduct decriminalized by the 2018 farm bill - and since sold as medicine, dietary supplements and infused in food, cosmetics and skincare products . "You cannot walk down the street without seeing the products " but there is a dearth of solid data on how safe and effective CBD actually is, said Hahn. Those CBD challenges have fueled larger discussions about how to better regulate the vast dietary supplement market, where manufacturers often push legal boundaries by making unverified claims about how herbal or homeopathic products can help people. "It will be something else next," said Hahn. We don't want to overstep our boun ds but we want to make sure that safe and effective products are in the hands of people."

Wondering if you have see the corona virus treatmen t news. I know you were involved in Ebola previously. You are a great Scientist and Doctor. Coronavirus update: WHO says prepare for local corona virus outbreaks in other countries; What do you think about this treatment. Regards, Amit SHEL TON, CONNECT JCUT -- Thursday, January 30, 2020 -- Nano Viricides, Joe. (NYSE Amer.: NNVC) (the "Company"), a global leader in the deve lopment of highly effective antiviral therapies based on a novel nanomedicin es platform, is confirm ing public disclosures in articles by various industry journals and other articles, that it is working on developing a treatmen t for the novel coronavirus 20 l 9-nCoV , or the Wuhan coronavirus. "We have already initiated a program for developing a treatment for the 2019-nCOV ," said Anil R. Diwan , PhD, President and Executive Chairman of the Company , adding, "Our platform technology enables possib ly the most rapid pathway for new drug deve lopment against viral diseases. Of course , we wi II need suppo rt from governmen tal and international agencies such as the US CDC, WHO , and Chinese CDC to successfu lly develop these treatments, and, if developed , to get them to the patients in the fastest possible time. At this time, the Company does no t have a col labora tion with any of these agencies, and we have not been contacted by any of these entities or asked to develop a treatment for this virus. We had collaborations with the CDC and USAMRII D in the past. The Company intends to pursue a relevant collaboration for testing of our drug candidates soon." The new 20 19-nCoV is known to be closely related to the SARS-CoV of 2002-2003 epidemic. In fact it has been shown to use the same cell surface receptor as SARS -Co V, nam ely ACE2 . "We have already found some lead candida te ligands in our chemical librar y tha t can bind to the SARS-CoV spike protein in the same fash ion as it binds to the cognate recep tor, ACE2, using molecu lar modeling tools," explained Dr. Diwan, add ing , "We believe this means we may already be significantly ahead in developing a po tential treatm ent for the new Wuhan virus. " While the Company commissions synthesi s of the anti-nCo V nanoviricide drug candidates for test ing , some of which are already in our hands , in pa rallel, the Company has also started preparing for testing of the candidates in cell cultures against certain known BSL2 coronaviruses , including ones that use the ACE2 receptor. Less threatfu l viruses in the same family that use the same receptor can serve as valid test viruses for screening our broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates . The Company ha, its own BSL2-certified virology laboratory at its Shelton campus where NIH-0024 16 

NIH-002417 it intends to perform this testing. The Company has its own cGMP-capable drug manufactu ring facility. This highly custom izable facility can be employed to produce severa l thousand doses of drugs per batch for treating coronavirus patients, if the Company's drug successfu lly transitions to obtai ning an explo ratory treatment approval for use in patients. The Company's platform technology has already proven that it can result in safe drugs. The Company 's first IND￾ready clinica l drug candidate , namely NV-HHV- 101, has successfu lly undergon e a standard battery of Safety and Toxicological testing , as previously disclosed by the Company in press releases and SEC filings. The Company is building on its previous work against coronaviruses . The Company's technology relies on copying the human cell-surface receptor to which the virus binds, and making small chemicals that are called "ligands" that will bind to the virus in the same fashion as the cognate receptor. These ligands are chemically attached to a nanomicelle, to create a nanoviricide®. It is anticipated that when a virus comes in contact with the nanoviricidc, not only woul d it land on the nanoviricide surface , binding to the copious number of ligands presented there, but it would also get entrapped because the nanomicelle polymer would turn around and fuse with the virus lipid envelo p, harnessing a well known biophysica l phenomenon. "It is like a 'Venus-Fly- Trap' for the virus, " explained Dr. Diwan . The Company focuses on developing broad-spectrum ligands and, thereby, broad-spectrum nanoviiicides , copying the specific human cellular receptor. No matter how much a virus mutates, it lands on the same cell surface receptor, and binds in the same fashion. Thus, it is highly unli.kely that a virus mjght escape a nanoviricide against it, in spite of mutations. Tn 2014 , the Company had worked on developing antiviral treatments against MERS-CoV , and coronaviruses in general. lt bad developed potential candidates for testing in animal models. The MERS-CoV threat was eclipsed by the Ebola epidemic of 2015 . The Compa ny developed viable drug candidates against Ebola in a rapid response time of a few weeks and sent them for testing to USAMRJID. These initial candidates showed significan t activity. The Company believes that another cycle of optimization would have resulted in a candidate ready for animal testing under the criteria estab lished by USAMRTJD then. During these previous ciises, the Company did not have the modern labs, the cGMP drug manufacturing facility or the BSL2 virology testing facility, all of which were commissioned after 2015 at its modern campus in Shelton, CT. The Company is preparing an IND application for its first clinica l drug candidate to go into human clinical trials. This drug candidate, NV-HHV-101, is a skin cream with the treatment of shingles rash as its first indication . It has shown broad-spectrum activity against HSY- I ( cause of "cold sores"), HSV-2 ( cause of "gerutal ulcers"), and VZV (the varicella-zoster virus, that causes chickenpox in children and immune-compromised humans, and shing les in adults). NV-HHV-101 has already gone through standard battery of safety-toxico logical testing, which provides confidence that our platform is capable of creating safe drugs. The Company has its own cGMP-c apable drug manufacturing facility where it intends to produce the drugs for clinical supply. The Company's top priority remruns working on its first IND application for NV-HHV-l01. The Company intends to solicit interest and financing from government agencies in order to accelerate its work on the coronaviruses . The market size for the treatment of shingles is estimated at approximately one billion dollars by various estimates. These estimates take into account the Shingrix® vaccine as well as existing vaccines. About 500,000 to 1 million cases of shing les occur in the USA alone every year. The market size for our immediate target drugs in the HerpeCid e™ program is variously estimate d at billions to tens of billions of dollars. The Company believes that its dermal topical cream for the treatment of shing les rash will be 

NIH-002418 its first drug heading into clinical trials. The Company believes that additional topical treatment candidates in the HerpeCide™ program, namely, HSY-I "cold sores" treatment, and HSV-2 "genital ulcers" treatment are expected to follow the shing les candidate into IND-enabling development and then into human clinical trials. These additional candidates are based on NV-HHV-101, thereby maximizing return on investments and shareholder value. The Company develops its class of drugs, that we call nanoviricides ®, using a platform technology. This approach enables rapid development of new drugs against a number of different viruses. A nanoviricide is a "biomimetic" - it is designed to "look like" the cell surface to the virus. The nanoviricide® technology enables direct attacks at multip le points on a virus particle. It is believed that such attacks would lead to the virus particle becoming ineffective at infecting cells. Antibodies in contrast attack a virus particle at only a maximum of two attachment points per antibody. In addition, the nanoviricide technology also simultaneously enables attacking the rapid intracellular reproduction of the virus by incorporating one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APls) within the core of the nanovi1icide. The nanoviricide technology is the only technology in the world, to the best of our knowledge , that is capable of both (a) attacking extracellular vims, thereby breaking the reinfection cycle, and simultaneously (b) disrupting intracellular production of the virus, thereby enabling complete control of a virus infection. About NanoYiricides NanoYiricides, Inc.(www.nanoviricides.com)is a development stage company that is creating special purpose nanomaterials for antiviral therapy. The Company's novel nanoviricide ® class of drug candidates are designed to specifically attack enveloped virus particles and to dismantle them. Our lead drug candidate is NV-HHY-101 with its first indication as dermal topical cream for the treatment of shingles rash. The Company is also developing drugs against a number of viral diseases including oral and genital Herpes, viral diseases of the eye including EKC and herpes keratitis, HIN l swine flu, H5Nl bird flu, seasonal Influenza, HlV , Hepatitis C, Rabies, Dengue fever, and Ebola virus, among others.

That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhe lming China and frightening the entire world. Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients - 53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influe nza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like, how it's changing, and how it might be stopped . "One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human-to-human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in NIH-002426 

Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan. In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on virological.org, nextstra in.org, preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the world to develop their ow n diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.) When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-which are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reported on 23 January on bioRxiv that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% simi lar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronav irus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relationship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scientists suspect there's an "intermedia ry" host species-or several-between bats and 2019-nCoV. According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstrain.org, a site he co￾founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are interact ive-by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences.) ~ -.... 10 - _,. -,_, --- -- '<.- ~ - F======::~:::;: s =-: __ -u , ,a NIH-002427 

Bedford's analyses of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV suggest that the two viruses shared a common ancestor 25 to 65 years ago, an estimate he arrived at by combining the difference in nucleotides between the viruses with the presumed rate s of mutation in other coronaviruses. So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019 -nCoV. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, simi larly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to huma ns from camels. And the phylogene ti c tree from Sh i's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MER$ link easy to see. 100 too 97 ,...-----TGEV ,---- Mink CoV ,..___ Ferret CoV .----- Bat CoV COPHE15 ,----- Scotophifus bat CoV 512 .__ ___ PEDV .----- Bat CoV HKU10 ..---- Minlopterus bat CoV 1 ._ ___ Miniopterus bat CoV HKU8 ~-- Human CoV NL63 ---- Bat NL63-related CoV .__ ____ Human CoV 229E ---~~ SAOS-CoV Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2 Human CoV OC43 ,..._ __ Murine hepatitis virus ---R at CoV HKU24 100 ,__ __ Human CoV HKU1 100 ,,__ 100-1 Human MERS-CoV Camel MERS-CoV ,....__ Plpistrellus bat CoV HKUS ,...._ __ Tytonycteris Bat CoV HKU4 Hedgehog CoV 90 too SARS -CoV BJ0 1 Civet SARS-CoV SZ3 Bat SARSr -GoV WIV1 Bat SARSr-CoV SHC014 Bat SARSr-CoV L YRa11 Bat SARSr-CoV Rf1 Bat SARSr-CoV ZC45 Bat SARSr-CoV HKU3-1 ,...._ __ Bat SARSr-CoV BM48-31 BetaCoV/Wuhan/W IV0S/2019 1oo BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV02 /2019 BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 BetaCoV/Wuh.in/WlV06 /2019 100 BctaCoV/Wuhan/W1V07 /2019 Bat CoV RaTG13 .__ _____ Bat Hp BetaCoV Zhejiang 2013 .__ ____ .----- Rousettus bat CoV HKU9 100 Bat CoV GCCOC1 ------IBV 0.1 The longer a virus circulates in a human populat ions, the more time it has to develop mutations that differentiate strains in infected people, and give n that the 2019-nCoV sequences analyzed to date differ from each other by seven nucleotides at most, this suggests it jumped into hum ans very recently. But it rema ins a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. "There's a very large gray area between viruses detec ted in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vince nt Munster, a virologist at the NIH-002428 

U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species. Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases- 27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another-were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful , were not . This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere . According to Xinhua, the state-run news agency, "environmenta l sampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is where wildlife were sold. "The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important," says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus." Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and dete rmine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research. One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces .

Virology, which is the premier lab in China that studies bat and human coronaviruses, has also come under fire. "Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research," read a headline on a story in The Washington Post that focused on the facility. Concerns about the institute predate this outbreak. Nature ran a story in 2017 about it building a new biosafety level 4 lab and included molecular biolog ist Richard Ebright of Rutgers University, Piscataway, expressing concerns about accidental infections, which he noted repeatedly happened with lab workers handling SARS in Beijing. Ebright, who has a long history of raising red flags about studies with dangerous pathogens, also in 2015 criticized an experiment in which modifications were made to a SARS-like virus circulating in Chinese bats to see whether it had the potential to cause disease in humans. Earlier this week, Ebright questioned t he accuracy of Bedford's calculat ion that there are at least 25 years of evolutionar y distance between RaTG13-the virus held in the Wuhan virology institute-and 2019-nCoV, arguing that the mutation rate may have been different as it passed through different hosts before humans. Ebright tells 5ciencelnsider that the 2019-nCoV data are "consistent with entry into the human population as a natural accident." Shi did not reply to emails from Science, but her longt ime collaborator, disease ecologist Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance, dismissed Ebright's conjecture. "Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out : This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus," Daszak says. "It's just a shame. It seems hum ans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face. There' s this incredible diversity of viruses in wildlife and we've just scratched the surface . Within that diversity, there will be some t hat can infect people and within that group wi ll be some that cause il lness." A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the EcoHealth Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses. EcoHealth Allia nce Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because th is virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that th at's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered. "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we' re going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV]." NIH-002430 

It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak, Daszak says. "If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak dies, there could be a cont inued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are."

That string of apparent gibberish is anything but: It's a snippet of a DNA sequence from the viral pathogen, dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), that is overwhe lming China and frightening the entire world . Scientists are publicly sharing an ever-growing number of full sequences of the virus from patients - 53 at last count in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database. These viral genomes are being intensely studied to try to understand the origin of 2019-nCoV and how it fits on the family tree of related viruses found in bats and other species. They have also given glimpses into what this newly discovered virus physically looks like, how it's changing, and how it might be stopped . NIH-002433 

NIH-002434 "One of the biggest takeaway messages [from the viral sequences] is that there was a single introduction into humans and then human-to -human spread," says Trevor Bedford, a bioinformatics specialist at the University of Washington, Seattle. The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market's environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan. In all, 2019-nCoV has nearly 29,000 nucleotides bases that hold the genetic instruction book to produce the virus. Although it's one of the many viruses whose genes are in the form of RNA, scientists convert the viral genome into DNA, with bases known in shorthand as A, T, C, and G, to make it easier to study. Many analyses of 2019-nCoV's sequences have already appeared on virological.org. nextstrain.org . preprint servers like bioRxiv, and even in peer-reviewed journals. The sharing of the sequences by Chinese researchers allowed public health labs around the world to develop their own diagnostics for the virus, which now has been found in 18 other countries. (Science's news stories on the outbreak can be found here.) When the first 2019-nCoV sequence became available, researchers placed it on a family tree of known coronaviruses-which are abundant and infect many species-and found that it was most closely related to relatives found in bats. A team led by Shi Zheng-Li, a coronavirus specialist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, repo rted on 23 January on bioRxiv that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% similar to a bat virus and had 79.5% similarity to the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease whose initial outbreak was also in China more than 15 years ago. But the SARS coronavirus has a similarly close relat ionship to bat viruses, and sequence data make a powerful case that it jumped into people from a coronavirus in civets that differed from human SARS viruses by as few as 10 nucleotides. That's one reason why many scient ists suspect there's an "intermediary" host species-or several-between bats and 2019-nCoV. According to Bedford's analysis, the bat coronavirus sequence that Shi Zheng-Li's team highlighted, dubbed RaTG13, differs from 2019-nCoV by nearly 1100 nucleotides. On nextstra in.org, a site he co￾founded, Bedford has created coronavirus family trees (example below) that include bat, civet, SARS, and 2019-nCoV sequences. (The trees are inte ractive-by dragging a computer mouse over them, it's easy to see the differences and similarities between the sequences.)

So it likely took decades for RaTG13-like viruses to mutate into 2019-nCoV. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another human disease caused by a coronavirus, simi larly has a link to bat viruses. But studies have built a compelling case it jumped to humans from camels. And the phylogene tic tree from Sh i's bioRxiv paper (below) makes the camel-MERS link easy to see. NIH-002435

But it remains a mystery which animal spread the virus to humans. "There's a very large gray area between viruses detected in bats and the virus now isolated in humans," says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses in bats, camels, and others species. Strong evidence suggests the marketplace played an early role in spreading 2019-nCoV, but whether it was the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain. Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases- 27 of the first 41 in one report , 26 of 47 in anothe r-were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful , were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere . NIH-002436 

According to Xinhua, the state-run news agency, "environmenta l sampling" of the Wuhan seafood market has found evidence of 2019-nCoV. Of the 585 samples tested, 33 were positive for 2019-nCoV and all were in the huge market's western portion, which is where wildlife were sold. "The positive tests from the wet market are hugely important/' says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who collaborated with the first group to publicly release a 2019-nCoV sequence. "Such a high rate of positive tests would strongly imply that animals in the market played a key role in the emergence of the virus." Yet there have been no preprints or official scientific reports on the sampling, so it's not clear which, if any, animals tested positive. "Until you consistently isolate the virus out of a single species, it's really, really difficult to try and dete rmine what the natural host is," says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research. One possible explanation for the confusion about where the virus first entered humans is if there was a batch of recently infected animals sold at different marketplaces. Or an infected animal trader could have transmi tted the virus to different people at different markets. Or, Bedford suggests, those early cases could have been infected by viruses that didn't easily transmit and sputtered out. "It would be hugely helpful to have just a sequence or two from the marketplace [environmental sampling] that could illuminate how man zoonoses occurred and when they occurred," Bedford says.

Within that diversity, there will be some that can infect people and within that group wi ll be some that cause illness." A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the EcoHealth Alliance have trapped bats in caves all over China, like this one in Guangdong, to sample them for coronaviruses. EcoHealth Alliance Daszak and Shi's group have for 8 years been trapping bats in caves around China to sample their feces and blood for viruses. He says they have sampled more than 10,000 bats and 2000 other species. They have found some 500 novel coronaviruses, about 50 of which fall relatively close to the SARS virus on the family tree, including RaTG13-it was fished out of a bat fecal sample they collected in 2013 from a cave in Moglang in Yunnan province. "We cannot assume that just because th is virus from Yunnan has high sequence identity with the new one that that's the origin," Daszak says, noting that only a tiny fraction of coronaviruses that infect bats have been discovered. "I expect that once we've sampled and sampled and sampled across southern China and central China that we're going to find many other viruses and some of them will be closer [to 2019-nCoV)." It's not just a "curious interest" to figure out what sparked the current outbreak , Daszak says. "If we don't find the origin, it could still be a raging infection at a farm somewhere, and once this outbreak NIH-002444 

dies, there could be a cont inued spillover that's really hard to stop. But the jury is still out on what the real origins of this are."
